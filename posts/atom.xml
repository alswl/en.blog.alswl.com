      <description>In order to be well prepared, how can I successfully join an electronics factory after graduating at the age of 35?
Learn from fixing keyboards(it&amp;rsquo;s a joke)
Background The keyboard I using is the ErgoDox, an ergonomically split keyboard. More details about ErgoDox can be found in my previous answer.
(former keycap color scheme + hand rest).
After seven or eight years of work, it has been into the water, into the coffee, but also into the soy milk, now finally a few keys are not flexible, pressed a sticky feeling, can not provide a smooth coding feel.</description>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my in-laws for taking the baby for summer vacation, so I can have a weekend to develop this system.
Also thanks to my wife, I did my own thing for two days during the weekend and didn&amp;rsquo;t criticize me.
Lastly, I would like to thank the company for the team building, providing a hotel to stay and spending a night to fix the Chinese handwriting.</description>
