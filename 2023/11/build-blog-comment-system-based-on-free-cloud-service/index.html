Recently, Disqus ads have become too intrusive, so I urgently need to find a new comment system.\nDisqus officially states that removing ads requires a paid subscription.\nWhat if I want to remove Ads? If you’d like to remove Disqus Ads from your integration, you may purchase and ads-free subscription from your Subscription and Billing page. More information on Disqus ads-free subscriptions may be found here.\nOK, goodbye Disqus—I’ll find a reliable, free, and easy-to-use comment system. Since I’m looking for a new comment system anyway, and it’s 2023 now, I want this new system to fully leverage the convenience of cloud services, and to be free, reliable, and easy to maintain.\nSelection Principles Before diving in, I outlined my principles and selection criteria:\nData ownership is the core requirement Ensure comment data fully belongs to the blog owner, with no loss of control due to third-party services. Deployment and storage are the main challenges Considering stability and cost, choose a solution that is easy to deploy and has low storage cost. Access speed is a consideration Comment system load speed directly affects user experience, so a system that offers fast access is needed. Functional requirements:\nEmail notifications Markdown Content safety: No Injection Comment moderation and deletion OAuth login (optional) Non-functional requirements:\nLow cost: within 12 CNY/year System stability With these principles and requirements clear, we can choose a suitable comment system in a more targeted way. Next, I’ll explore how to select and set up a comment system based on these principles.\nInitial Exploration Now let’s try out some options and explore, to get familiar with the features and quality of common systems today.\nutterances A comment system often seen in the wild, popular among developers; based on GitHub Issues, so it’s free; requires GitHub account to comment. 7.8k stars Hosted on GitHub Issues Twikoo A solution from China, built around cloud services; requires a serverless/cloud function environment (most are paid). 880 stars Cusdis A solution from China; offers free Cloud service (with limited quota). 2.4k stars Supports migration Manual comment approval Moderate activity I also looked at some external comparison articles:\nComments | Hugo 静态博客评论系统的选择 - 腾讯云开发者社区-腾讯云 轻量级开源免费博客评论系统解决方案 （Cusdis + Railway） - 少数派 From this exploration, the deployment model looks roughly like this:\nComparison Here is a comparison table of features I care about and how each candidate performs. Besides the systems above, I also looked into comment SaaS services commonly used overseas:\nName self-host Official SaaS SaaS Free Star Import Disqus export data Comments Utterances x v v 7.8k v Github account required Cusdis v v v? 2.3k v v? import from Disqus failed Cactus Comments v v 100 Matrix Protocol, blocked Commento x v $10/month v v Graph Comment v Free to $7 Hyvor Talk x v $12/month IntenseDebate v ? x too old Isso v x 4.8k v sqlite storage Mutt v $16/month Remark42 v x 4.3k v v full featured, one file storage ReplyBox v $5/month Staticman v 2.3k v using github as storage Talkyard v €4.5/ month Waline v 1.5k v v Multi Storage / Service Provider supported Twikoo v x 1.1k v v FaaS / MongoDB From this comparison we can draw a few conclusions:\nTraditional overseas comment systems have low data transparency and old-fashioned UIs. Official SaaS offerings are mostly paid. Self-hosted options require running your own service, with no one-click free cloud path. Summary\nThe products that best fit my needs are: Utterances, Cusdis, and Waline.\nPoC and Implementation I eventually chose Utterances and Waline for a PoC. My English blog uses Utterances, and my Chinese blog uses Waline.\nWhy not Cusdis or Twikoo? Cusdis uses PostgreSQL, while Twikoo relies on Tencent Cloud Functions (limited free tier) or MongoDB. Waline offers more storage options. Among similar solutions, Waline has the most contributors and commits, so the community is more reliable.\nWaline Implementation One funny detail: if the h3 heading here were “Waline”, it would inject the comment widget for this blog right there.\nPros Multi-platform deployment Multiple database backends (MongoDB, sqlite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) Rich comment features Import tools Active enough Cons Feature-heavy, not very minimal (but configurable) Product from China Integration steps: Choose a storage provider (I chose LeanCloud) Choose a server provider for deployment (I chose Vercel) Choose an email provider (I chose Brevo (formerly SendinBlue)) Frontend integration (embed in Hugo) Deployment diagram:\nFor the actual steps, follow the official docs:\nQuick Start | Waline Deploy on Vercel | Waline Bind CNAME Import data Convert with Migration Tool | Waline Import at https://console.leancloud.app/apps/yours/storage/import-export Page configuration Disable some features via client props Enable SMTP Set AUTHOR_EMAIL Set SENDER_NAME Set SENDER_EMAIL Server config: https://waline.js.org/reference/server/config.html#tgtemplate Issues I ran into Disqus export does not include user emails, so Gravatar avatars don’t show; no workaround Email config needs extra env vars, otherwise your personal email can be exposed Implementation PR (frontend only; backend contains secrets and isn’t shared): feat: comments on waline · alswl/blog.alswl.com@e34e348\nUtterances Implementation Utterances is even simpler to set up—a single PR enables it. feat: comment using utteranc · alswl/en.blog.alswl.com@29028f6 (github.com)\nNothing fancy, just simplicity. Given the low traffic on my English blog, the minimal approach works.\nSummary I ended up with Waline and Utterances as my comment systems; both have zero deployment cost.\nI traded some access speed and security for better data control and a self-hosted setup. In terms of stability, although the chain is more complex and a single node can fail, relying on Vercel, LeanCloud, and Brevo keeps overall risk manageable.\nAfter all, it’s just a small comment system—zero cost and “it works” is enough.\nFeel free to try leaving a comment below.\n",

<ul>
<li>Low cost: within 12 CNY/year</li>
<li>System stability</li>
</ul>
<p>With these principles and requirements clear, we can choose a suitable comment system in a more targeted way. Next, I&rsquo;ll explore how to select and set up a comment system based on these principles.</p>

<p>From this comparison we can draw a few conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional overseas comment systems have low data transparency and old-fashioned UIs.</li>
<li>Official SaaS offerings are mostly paid.</li>
<li>Self-hosted options require running your own service, with no one-click free cloud path.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The products that best fit my needs are: Utterances, Cusdis, and Waline.</p>
<h2 id="poc-and-implementation">PoC and Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#poc-and-implementation">#</a></h2>
<p>I eventually chose Utterances and Waline for a PoC.
My <a href="https://en.blog.alswl.com/">English blog</a> uses Utterances,
and my <a href="https://blog.alswl.com/">Chinese blog</a> uses Waline.</p>
<p>Why not Cusdis or Twikoo? Cusdis uses PostgreSQL,
while Twikoo relies on Tencent Cloud Functions (limited free tier) or MongoDB.
Waline offers more storage options.
Among similar solutions, Waline has the most contributors and commits,
so the community is more reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One funny detail: if the h3 heading here were &ldquo;Waline&rdquo;, it would inject the comment widget for this blog right there.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Multi-platform deployment</li>
<li>Multiple database backends (MongoDB, sqlite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)</li>
<li>Rich comment features</li>
<li>Import tools</li>
<li>Active enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>Feature-heavy, not very minimal (but configurable)</li>
<li>Product from China</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration steps:
<ul>
<li>Choose a storage provider (I chose <mark>LeanCloud</mark>)</li>
<li>Choose a server provider for deployment (I chose <mark>Vercel</mark>)</li>
<li>Choose an email provider (I chose <mark>Brevo</mark> (formerly SendinBlue))</li>
<li>Frontend integration (embed in Hugo)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues I ran into
<ul>
<li>Disqus export does not include user emails, so Gravatar avatars don&rsquo;t show; no workaround</li>
<li>Email config needs extra env vars, otherwise your personal email can be exposed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation PR (frontend only; backend contains secrets and isn’t shared):
<a href="https://github.com/alswl/blog.alswl.com/commit/e34e34810298fd0d716d4c4a467fada25b3a6622">feat: comments on waline · alswl/blog.alswl.com@e34e348</a></p>
<h3 id="utterances-implementation">Utterances Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#utterances-implementation">#</a></h3>
<p>Utterances is even simpler to set up—a single PR enables it.
<a href="https://github.com/alswl/en.blog.alswl.com/commit/29028f677e362570a8bcaf5316847ddfa3e9d685">feat: comment using utteranc · alswl/en.blog.alswl.com@29028f6 (github.com)</a></p>
<p>Nothing fancy, just simplicity. Given the low traffic on my English blog, the minimal approach works.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>I ended up with Waline and Utterances as my comment systems; both have zero deployment cost.</p>
<p>I traded some access speed and security for better data control and a self-hosted setup.
In terms of stability, although the chain is more complex and a single node can fail,
relying on Vercel, LeanCloud, and Brevo keeps overall risk manageable.</p>
<p>After all, it’s just a small comment system—zero cost and “it works” is enough.</p>
