      <description>In order to be well prepared, how can I successfully join an electronics factory after graduating at the age of 35?
Learn from fixing keyboards(it&amp;rsquo;s a joke)
Background The keyboard I using is the ErgoDox, an ergonomically split keyboard. More details about ErgoDox can be found in my previous answer.
(former keycap color scheme + hand rest).
After seven or eight years of work, it has been into the water, into the coffee, but also into the soy milk, now finally a few keys are not flexible, pressed a sticky feeling, can not provide a smooth coding feel.</description>

      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my in-laws for taking the baby for summer vacation, so I can have a weekend to develop this system.
Also thanks to my wife, I did my own thing for two days during the weekend and didn&amp;rsquo;t criticize me.
Lastly, I would like to thank the company for the team building, providing a hotel to stay and spending a night to fix the Chinese handwriting.</description>

<p>Introduce Excalidraw, product features</p>

<p>What is Excalidraw, <mark>it&rsquo;s (probably) the most powerful online collaborative drawing tool</mark>, you can try it by visiting <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Excalidraw works very well, I summarize a few points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand Writing style (Hand Writing) to avoid OCD, what a pixel difference, are gone lie flat in the end</li>
<li>No delay in online collaboration, ideal for communication and collaboration in the post-epidemic era</li>
<li>The design of the product is excellent: shortcuts, object connection sticking, selected files directly to the local storage and other details are there</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>After this product was promoted internally by our internal partners, we quickly fell in love with it and put a lot of diagrams on Excalidraw, but it also led to a new problem.</p>
<center><mark><b>Public SaaS services have data security risks</b></mark></center>
<center><mark><b> What to do? I'm going to self hosted it!</b></mark></center>
<h2 id="2-before-deploying-lets-understand-how-excalidraw-works">#2 Before deploying, let&rsquo;s understand how Excalidraw works</h2>
<p><strong>How Excalidraw works and how self hosted works</strong>：</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/excalidraw-arch.png" alt="excalidraw-arch.png"  />

</p>
<p>So what is the core difficulty of self hosted.</p>
<p>Solving the excalidraw-storage data storage problem, aka. replacing the Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s firebase service.</p>
<h2 id="3-self-hosted-poc">#3 Self hosted PoC</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If things don&rsquo;t work out, ask yourself</p>
<p>- Mencius</p>
<p>It is better to seek from Github than to seek from yourself.</p>
<p>- alswl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at Excalidraw&rsquo;s storage system.
Firebase is Google&rsquo;s Serverless service, formerly an independent company (and quite popular), but later acquired by GCP.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/firebase.png" alt="firebase.png"  />

</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/firebase-features.png" alt="firebase-features.png"  />

</p>
<p>I started with the idea of replacing Firebase and found a community service <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a> (found a free SaaS service, amazing)</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/supabase.png" alt="supabase.png"  />

</p>
<p>However, after careful research, I found that Supabase&rsquo;s API is not compatible with firebase and <mark> cannot be simply replaced with </mark>.</p>
<p>Excalidraw also relies on Excalidraw+ to provide a paid service. Is there a simple and viable solution from the community? I found a bit of a solution within the community:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/1772">Self hosting Excalidraw - Umbrella issue · Issue #1772 · excalidraw/excalidraw</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions/3879">Collaboration mode - Self-hosting vs Collab on top of · Discussion #3879 · excalidraw/excalidraw (github.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They gave a way (although it was later proven that there was still a crooked way).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-fork">Kilian Decaderincourt / Excalidraw Fork · GitLab</a> forked excalidraw</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-storage-backend">Kilian Decaderincourt / excalidraw-storage-backend · GitLab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So I started reviewing their solution, opened the code and saw that I had the right idea (replacing several interfaces of firebase), using my own KV storage (Redis / MySQL / Mongo) to replace it.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/jing-shen.png" alt="jing-shen.png"  />

</p>
<p>Attempted deployment and immediately ran into problems with:</p>
<center><mark><b> Dockerfile build failed </b></mark></center>
<center><mark><b> Versions too far behind upstream (2020 -> 2022)</b></mark></center>
<center><mark><b> Merged with Rebase Unable to follow Upstream</b></mark></center>
<p>What a coincidence that I&rsquo;m <mark><b>Frontend Intern // Community Patching Specialist // Kubernetes Cleaner // YAML Senior Specialist </b></mark>, specializing in these few things.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="5-futureor-not">#5 Future(or not)</h2>
<p>Excalidraw is a free version of the SaaS service, <mark><b>Excalidraw+ is a paid version </b></mark>, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/excalidraw-price.png" alt="excalidraw-price.png"  />

</p>
<p>To sum up.</p>
<ul>
<li>More reliable storage, integrated to cloud storage (e.g. iCloud / NAS)</li>
<li>User identification, connected to a common identity system</li>
<li>More personalized permissions control (password access, targeted sharing), tenant control, project group control</li>
<li>Library shared within the domain</li>
<li>Integration with other systems (Yuque, Dingtalk Documents, Lark, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, just <mark><b>buy Excalidraw enterprise</b></mark> version!!! Less works, more enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="6-chinese-handwriting-optimization">#6 Chinese handwriting optimization</h2>
<p>One problem is that <mark><b> Chinese fonts are not handwritten </b></mark>, which is very incongruous. Let&rsquo;s see which fonts work first.</p>
<p>Chinese handwriting fonts supported by macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT212587">https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT212587</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT212587">macOS Monterey 附带的字体 - 官方 Apple 支持 (中国)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>cursive family:</p>
<ul>
<li>PanziPen</li>
<li>LingWai</li>
<li>Hannotate</li>
</ul>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202210/hanzipen-sc.png" alt="hanzipen-sc.png"  />

</p>
<p>Windows Chinese support for handwriting is poor, you have to install Office to have more options: 华文行楷; 方正舒体 (release in Office)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22703287">https://www.zhihu.com/question/22703287</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/22703287">Windows 系统内置的中文字体为什么只有那几种？不多内置几种字体呢？ - 知乎 (zhihu.com)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/Microsoft_Windows%E5%AD%97%E5%9E%8B%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8">https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/Microsoft_Windows字型列表</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If not, only the system&rsquo;s own italic KaiTi will work.</p>
<p>Finally, relying on my poor front-end level, I made a PoC and submitted a PR to the official: [feat: simple impl of multi font support, for chinese font by alswl - Pull Request #5604 - excalidraw/excalidraw] (<a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5604">https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5604</a>)</p>
<p>Here is the final result.</p>
<p>

</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="update-2022-12">Update 2022-12</h2>
<p>A few users came to me to ask how to deploy it.
So based on the above solution, I provided a set of one-click pull-up services based on Docker Compose: with collaboration, Chinese font support.
