      <description>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my in-laws for taking the baby for summer vacation, so I can have a weekend to develop this system.
Also thanks to my wife, I did my own thing for two days during the weekend and didn&amp;rsquo;t criticize me.
Lastly, I would like to thank the company for the team building, providing a hotel to stay and spending a night to fix the Chinese handwriting.</description>
