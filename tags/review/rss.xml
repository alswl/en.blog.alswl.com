      <title>2024 Year in Review</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;life---show-me-your-photos&#34;&gt;Life - Show me your photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth keeps orbiting the sun; as time passes, we brush past life, carrying memories of the past and stepping into the unknown ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I set myself a goal about life: &lt;strong&gt;family and companionship&lt;/strong&gt;. One part was “quality time together,” and another was “learning to take pleasing snapshots.” On every trip, I wanted to capture the play of light and shadow and the warmth of the moment in photos. This year, that theme became — &lt;strong&gt;Show me your photos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The Earth keeps orbiting the sun; as time passes, we brush past life, carrying memories of the past and stepping into the unknown ahead.</p>
<p>Last year, I set myself a goal about life: <strong>family and companionship</strong>. One part was “quality time together,” and another was “learning to take pleasing snapshots.” On every trip, I wanted to capture the play of light and shadow and the warmth of the moment in photos. This year, that theme became — <strong>Show me your photos</strong>.</p>

<p>This year I shifted from explorer to someone driving systematic evolution in an organized way. Early in the year I even had a sense that the skeleton of the “building” was in place—next would be steady construction to keep the flywheel moving, and I started to explore new directions in AIGC, hoping to find a breakthrough there.</p>
<p>Reality soon delivered a sharp wake-up call. As AIGC grew explosively, we witnessed history while facing a huge surge in compute demand. Wave after wave of pressure landed; new demands and old debt tangled together and put massive strain on infrastructure delivery. Several core colleagues in this space left within a few months. People left, but the work had to go on. From June I was on the front line with a small team.</p>
<p>There were times I felt close to breaking. I wrote a series of posts about “<a href="https://x.com/alswl/status/1791341868439195945">death march</a>.”</p>
<p>Pain often leads to reflection, especially when things feel unbearable—it can sharpen insight. When you’re near the bottom, the rebound can begin. At some point I understood: the problems are temporary; what we’re really building is the inner capacity to face difficulty with clarity and to see problems squarely.</p>
<p>No need to fear others’ judgment or to resent the messiness of collaboration. The situation and the problems are there; the solutions aren’t mysterious—the key is to face them. With a calm mind and realistic expectations, we can see the roots of problems in the chaos, spot opportunity in difficulty, and glimpse the future in the present. Real strength is drawing wisdom from each challenge and courage from each setback.</p>

<h2 id="reading---a-pleasant-surprise">Reading - A pleasant surprise</h2>
<p>After getting a Boox e-reader this year, my reading volume jumped. I read 34 books in total, mostly nonfiction; 10 of them I rated five stars. With Kindle gone from China, WeChat Read became the main option. I don’t own the books, but the cost dropped a lot—uploading two books per month is enough. I also changed my view on audiobooks: I used to look down on them, but now I find listening while doing chores or commuting a good way to use my brain.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26925171/">The Ming Dynasty 1566 (Douban)</a></p>
<p>

<p>Brilliant—the actors’ lines could almost be used as-is with no changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36328704/">Too Bad, Old Tai Bai (Douban)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26874220/">Huawei Internal Training (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s29042375.jpg" alt="Huawei Internal Training"  />


</p>
<p>Huawei’s management philosophy and Alibaba’s “Six Meridians” share a focus on customers and goals. Though the ideas are similar, Huawei’s manual lacks case studies, and culture is often shaped by resolving real conflicts. The book stresses direction, professionalism, execution, and self-criticism—all important for growth. Huawei started in network equipment and became a diversified tech giant; its hardware DNA may help it stay steady. Alibaba and other internet companies have had a rougher time in the market lately.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/35328607/">Origin (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s33804010.jpg" alt="Origin"  />


</p>
<p>Highly recommended. It covers the origin of the universe and the birth and evolution of life. It reminded me of a documentary I saw as a kid, <em>The Universe and Us</em>. I’d like to dig into the terminology someday—it spans macro and micro physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36449803/">This Is ChatGPT (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s34566250.jpg" alt="This Is ChatGPT"  />


</p>
<p>A master in the field explains the essentials to newcomers. Reading papers was dry and the details didn’t connect; this book helped tie it together. The Transformer attention mechanism isn’t covered much, but commenters added more in the reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/30270959/">Deep Learning from Scratch (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s29815955.jpg" alt="Deep Learning from Scratch"  />


</p>
<p>A solid intro to deep learning. Unlike “how to use” books, this one focuses on “how to build”—it implements a simple framework in Python and applies it to handwritten digit recognition. It walks through what each layer does, with the math and intuition. Though it’s been out for almost five years, the content still holds; the outlook at the end, including object recognition and RNN (the basis of GPT), is very relevant today.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/35876121/">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s34241855.jpg" alt="The Almanack of Naval Ravikant"  />


</p>
<p>The book is like a mental massage—a short lift, but you still have to act. When I’m stuck, I need that kind of relief. Reading the chapter on emotional regulation reminded me of a recent work conflict where I lost my temper. I knew the principles; maybe if I’d read Naval’s chapter earlier I could have stayed rational. Good books deserve rereading. The chapters on wealth and judgment hit hardest: do high-leverage work to build wealth; use stable mental models; learn math, especially probability and statistics.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/30175059/">Lee Kuan Yew: One Man’s View of the World (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s33687518.jpg" alt="Lee Kuan Yew: One Man&rsquo;s View of the World"  />


</p>
<p>As a statesman, having the will, the drive, depth of thought, and a broad view free from dogma already puts him in the top tier. What’s rare is Lee Kuan Yew’s candor—likely tied to Singapore’s size and its people. The comments on this book are dense; other readers added many angles (and what happened afterward).</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26171466/">The Hard Road (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s33986279.jpg" alt="The Hard Road"  />


</p>
<p>A remarkable book. The author, a Party history researcher, discusses at length the political and economic line disputes from the founding of the PRC to the present. He doesn’t shy away from describing Mao—I saw someone in a hurry to reach communism in one go and leave a classless society, launching movement after movement. Deng’s course correction and reform and opening up followed. Moving to think of a generation’s sacrifice—each number a broken family. I hope for less grand narrative and more attention to daily life and people’s welfare.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/35317149/">At the Bend of the Gorge (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s33945521.jpg" alt="At the Bend of the Gorge"  />


</p>
<p>From obscurity to the spotlight. The writing feels sincere and plain; I was moved to tears more than once by Chen Xingjia’s integrity, warmth, and vitality. Some say it’s performance; I’d rather believe in that sincerity and hold to what I choose to believe.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36480389/">The Unvanquished (Douban)</a></p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202501/s34996310.jpg" alt="The Unvanquished"  />


</p>
<p><em>The Unvanquished</em>—a domestic sci-fi collection that surprised me. Mo Xiong’s style has a push toward the edge of the universe; he takes a fragment of space opera and brings it close to the reader. “The Carrier Pigeon” blends soft and hard SF, with reason and emotion bound by the speed of light. “White Ghost” reads like a power fantasy. “The Unvanquished” reminded me of the Weeping Angels in <em>Doctor Who</em>—a kind of hunt across timelines. Both the hunt and the way out are clever and unexpected.</p>
<h2 id="last">Last</h2>
<p>Here’s to a new year that is both lively and quiet, deep and simple.</p>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my 35th year. I am familiar with playing multiple roles: father, husband, son—each moment woven with companionship and growth.
The pace of life seems rushed, but I try to keep a young heart and a curiosity and passion for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my time is taken by daily life; only on the subway and at the dinner table do I feel in control of my time.
Fortunately, I don’t feel tired or dull. Instead, I’ve gradually adapted to this change of identity.
Perhaps it’s in these mundane routines that I’ve found a rhythm of life—a calm and warm state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</p>
<p>This is my 35th year. I am familiar with playing multiple roles: father, husband, son—each moment woven with companionship and growth.
The pace of life seems rushed, but I try to keep a young heart and a curiosity and passion for the world.</p>
<p>Most of my time is taken by daily life; only on the subway and at the dinner table do I feel in control of my time.
Fortunately, I don’t feel tired or dull. Instead, I’ve gradually adapted to this change of identity.
Perhaps it’s in these mundane routines that I’ve found a rhythm of life—a calm and warm state.</p>
<p>This year we traveled to Beijing, Hanzhong, Xi’an, Chun’an, Changsha, Zhangjiajie, and Taizhou.
With the new year approaching, we’re preparing to get a passport for our child and go out to see the world.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202401/tower.png" alt="tower"  />


</p>
<p>While accompanying our child—joining nature courses, visiting exhibitions—I’ve found that we’re growing together without realizing it.
On another front, I borrowed two cameras from my mother and finally decided to learn photography properly.
I sold my Canon 6D and kept the lightweight APS-C Sony a6500.
I hope photography becomes a way to express myself and document life; each photo is a frozen moment and a witness to time.</p>

</p>
<p>In the world of games, I seem to have hit a period of “gaming impotence.” Almost every game I buy becomes boring after an hour.
Maybe real life is the most compelling game of all.</p>
<p>Perhaps life is an ever-changing adventure. On the stage of time, we play various roles and tell our own stories.</p>
<h2 id="work--getting-better">Work — Getting Better</h2>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202401/balloon.png" alt="balloon"  />


</p>
<p>Work has been under great pressure and tension, and I’ve become more of an explorer.
Over the past two years, I’ve kept pushing projects to launch; about half of the new products from our department were my responsibility. I like this domain and really want to do it well.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, I feel a bit like a cleaner the company hired—in a “scattered, multiple, hanging” state.
In a complex environment, solving problems is never easy. While tidying up messes, new mess is still being generated, and the cleanup never ends.
In reality, attention keeps shifting to new things (like AIGC), and existing problems are often ignored.</p>
<p>The broader company environment keeps changing. Some old colleagues have left, and our larger org has gone through changes too.
From a risk-oriented re-org to a compute-oriented infrastructure team. I see this as a good sign:
AI Infra will continue to drive the whole Infra space forward, and compute management will become a new theme.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects--more-connections">Side Projects — More Connections</h2>
<p>In the scattered shapes of GitHub data, the year’s tinkering is reflected—though I’m sorry I didn’t contribute more to the open-source community.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202401/contributions.png" alt="contributions"  />


</p>
<p>My main open-source contribution this year was <a href="https://github.com/alswl/excalidraw-collaboration">alswl/excalidraw-collaboration</a>.
This self-hosted Excalidraw version combines collaboration and Chinese font support. This project and related ones have attracted nearly 300
stars, making it one of my most impactful personal open-source projects, even though it’s a front-end product.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>During the summer, while the little one was away, I built a small app for naming babies. Although the product is a bit unfinished and
losing money, I still hope to spend more time developing and improving it. A good name can bring a family a lot of joy;
I hope this project can at least cover the server costs.</p>
<p>I also became active on Twitter again this year, sharing tips and thoughts. My followers grew from a few hundred to nearly 4,000.
There’s still a gap to being an influential account, but connecting with many interesting people is rewarding in itself.</p>
<p>My most popular content this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>167k reposts: The war against software complexity <a href="https://twitter.com/alswl/status/1714467723567329309">X</a></li>

<p>The most valuable post to me was the one about “许世伟’s Architecture Course” <a href="https://twitter.com/alswl/status/1738411522756665350">X</a>, which earned several months of Twitter subscription fees.</p>
<p>I also started listening to podcasts again and went through most of the “内核恐慌” (Kernel Panic) archive. I missed their active period,
but at the Bund Conference I had a chance to join their meetup and talk with Rio and 吴涛 in person. Ironically, a colleague was there too,
but we didn’t recognize each other—a reminder that in a large company, you can work together and still not know each other (we had both been Go language judges).</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Besides 内核恐慌, I’ve been listening to “硬地骇客” without missing an episode, and recently started “有知有行” as well.</p>
<p>On the blog, I published two posts on engineering practice, hoping they’d be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.alswl.com/2023/04/web-api-guidelines/">Practical Web API Guidelines</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alswl.com/2023/07/architecture-design-the-easy-way/">Architecture Design the Easy Way</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I most want to share is the Obsidian Tasks plugin. You can find the details in my post
<a href="https://blog.alswl.com/2023/02/gtd/">From Toodledo to Obsidian Tasks — My GTD Best Practice</a>. I’m also happy to be a sponsor of Obsidian Tasks.</p>
<p>Looking back at the year, I’ve come to realize I only have about 10 hours per week for side projects—very precious.
I look forward to financial freedom one day so I can have more time for hobbies and interests.</p>

</p>
<p>Most of my reading is still non-fiction.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26318286/">Memories of the Cowshed (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>One can be killed or humiliated; the past brings melancholy, the present confusion, the future hope.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26628557/">Su Shu (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>On how to conduct oneself and handle affairs—ancient wisdom. Worth rereading; especially helpful to flip through when feeling restless.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26279084/">Translation as the Great Way (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>Read it to understand the normal and abnormal state of the Chinese language.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26836970/">Dune (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>The old Baron moves his house to a new planet; the young noble enters the desert world. The Emperor secretly empowers the Harkonnens; House Atreides is judged. Young Paul leads the Fremen; Jessica bears the posthumous child. Muad’Dib counterattacks on Arrakis, marries Chani and claims the throne.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/30147790/">A Hundred Years of Ups and Downs (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>State, enterprise, people, central, local. Pessimistic.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/36150914/">The Courage to Be Disliked (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>I wish I had read this at 20. (I don’t need it now.) It teaches how to get along with yourself, others, and the world; how to talk to yourself and change. Same vein as <em>Meeting Your Unknown Self</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/24530465/">The Old Regime and the Revolution (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>Cycles of order and chaos repeat. The unconscious of the crowd; are democracy and elite rule the cure? One measure of stability is the wealth gap. Authoritarian systems also breed the risk of upheaval.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/5401859/">Secrets Behind the Door (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>A quick operations manual for management basics.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/33438811/">The Book of Why (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>I can’t give this book a star rating—it’s beyond my scope. It might be the theory of a new discipline (causal inference), or a spark within statistics. The author, Pearl, is a heavyweight in statistics and AI; in his later years he turned against much of his earlier methodology. Most of the machine learning we know today is based on probabilistic correlation—from beer and diapers to today’s GPT and AIGC. Pearl argues that what really matters is asking “why,” i.e., explaining causation. Causal reasoning requires the ability to imagine what does not exist, which current AI may not grasp (maybe?). The book was published in 2019; the author is now 87. I wonder what he makes of the current AIGC wave.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/3248513/">Why Are the Chinese So Hardworking Yet Not Wealthy (豆瓣)</a></p>
<p>The author is right but not comprehensive.</p>
<h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>High-quality time with family: put down the phone, get outdoors</p></blockquote>
<p>I did Wednesday and Friday family days with the kids; I take them to school every morning; we always have one weekend day out.</p>
<p>I’m not as good as my wife at being with the kids—thanks to her for everything she does for the family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Publish at least one post per month, especially on Kubernetes / dev design</p></blockquote>
<p>I published 6 posts this year, 50% of the target. Two of them—<a href="https://blog.alswl.com/2023/04/web-api-guidelines/">Practical Web API Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://blog.alswl.com/2023/07/architecture-design-the-easy-way/">Architecture Design the Easy Way</a>—I’m quite happy with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After COVID, I planned to get a personal trainer for gym workouts</p></blockquote>
<p>Not done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aim for 10% investment return; as a beginner I focused on equity funds. Actual return 3.9%, beating the market and Yu’e Bao</p></blockquote>
<p>This year’s return was -1.35%. I got hit right after leaving the beginner village; I still lack understanding of markets and business.</p>
<p>New year’s flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality family time, get outdoors, participate together</li>
<li>Keep publishing solid posts, especially on Kubernetes / PaaS</li>
<li>More exercise</li>
<li>Learn the basics of investing and build common sense and logic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="last">Last</h2>
<p>Every experience, every reunion, every book is a thread of fate. The new year has arrived.
I look forward to continuing to explore the meaning of life with family and friends—to experience the great and the small.</p>
