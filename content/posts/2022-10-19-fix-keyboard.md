## Background



The keyboard I using is the ErgoDox, an ergonomically split keyboard. More details about ErgoDox can be found in my previous [answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/52088337/answer/141073759).

(former keycap color scheme + hand rest).

After seven or eight years of work, it has been into the water, into the coffee, but also into the soy milk, now finally a few keys are not flexible, pressed a sticky feeling, can not provide a smooth coding feel.


After a few months of using a back up Filco, I finally made up my mind to get the ErgoDox fixed.

Youthfulness is back~
