<p>This issue has bothered me for a long time, starting during my school days, and every time I needed to communicate and discuss with my team members.
From the initial free style to the later REST, I often referenced <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">Github v3</a> to the project team and the
Foursqure API (no longer accessible, exposing age) documentation.
However, in practice, there are still cases where there is a mismatch with the actual work or the common company specification.
This is when I need to do some additional work. Eventually, I will write a brief <code>DEVELOPMENT.md</code> document to describe the design solution.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always had more ideas for that document, and it&rsquo;s not quite good enough. So, I wanted to put together a <mark>Simple and Pragmatic</mark> Web API best practice, which is this article.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-need-api-uniformity-specifications">Why We Need API Uniformity Specifications</h2>
<p>The problem seems obvious, but a deeper analysis involves teamwork efficiency and engineering design philosophy.</p>
<p>API (Application Programming Interface) is the bridge between different software systems to interact with each other. When communicating between different software systems, the
APIs allow data transfer and processing in a standardized way, enabling the integration of various applications.</p>
<p>When we start writing API documentation, a paradigm (Design Pattern) emerges, whether it is explicit or implicit, whether
Whether it is one set for each or a common set. This is just like when we use a unified USB interface, unification reduces costs and avoids possible errors. Specifically, there are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of understanding and efficiency: service providers and consumers use a unified form, structure and usage, and a unified production-consumption protocol, thus reducing communication costs.</li>
<li>Expert experience: It contains best engineering practices with corresponding solutions for common scenarios, avoiding the need for everyone to rethink the entire API system.
For example, how do you handle API caching? How to perform authentication? How to handle data formatting?</li>
<li>Extensibility: extensibility require stable protocols, protocols are abstract and implementation-independent, and not everyone has them
The ability to design uncertainty-oriented systems, and some widely used technologies plan for a wider range of scenarios.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><small>image by alswl</small></p>
<p>While it is true that there are some costs associated with the use of a unified specification that requires framework understanding and promotion, I believe that in most scenarios
the benefits of a unified specification far outweigh these costs.</p>
<p>However, not all cases require consideration of the API specification. For short lifecycle projects, internal projects and products with a very small impact
specifications may not require much attention. In addition, in some special business scenarios, the
The underlying protocol may change, and the existing specification may no longer be applicable. But even so, I still recommend redrafting a new specification, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-rules">Principles of rules</h2>
<p>When developing API specifications, we should follow some basic principles to deal with technical differences, and I have summarized three principles that have gained wide acceptance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: Simplicity is the most direct and effective strategy to resist complexity, using the principle of simplicity to reduce complexity and avoid the breeding and proliferation of complexity;</li>
<li>Consistency: uniform design patterns and continuity of design styles help reduce engineering costs and the psychological burden on engineers;</li>
<li>follow reality: follow the abstractions and layering of existing engineering domains (e.g. HTTP, REST, RBAC, OIDC, etc.) and do not invent new concepts of your own.
Always think about whether the problem is the only one you have encountered (the answer is definitely no).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-rest-work-or-not">Does REST work or not?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful API</a> has become a popular protocol in the Web API space.
Its broad applicability and reach stems from its binding to the HTTP protocol, which allows RESTful APIs to easily interact with existing Web technologies. If you are not familiar with REST, you can check out [Yifeng Ruan&rsquo;s
You can check out <a href="https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/05/restful_api.html">Yifeng Ruan&rsquo;s RESTful API Design Guide</a> and
<a href="https://www.oschina.net/translate/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api?print">Best Practices for RESTful API Design</a>.</p>
<p>REST is a high maturity protocol, which <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level0">Leonard Richardson</a>
describes it as having four levels of maturity:</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202304/rest-four-level.png" alt="rest-four-level"  />

<ol>
<li>The Swamp of POX, using HTTP to host the Legacy protocol (XML)</li>
<li>Resources: using resource abstraction</li>
<li>HTTP Verbs: using rich HTTP Verbs</li>
<li>Hypermedia Controls: API resource integration using <code>rel</code> links, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a> is the pinnacle of performance</li>
</ol>
<p>The core strength of REST is that</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes full advantage of the design of the HTTP Protocol (HTTP Protocol)</li>
<li>It has excellent identification of resources</li>
<li>It is designed with complete manipulation of resources (Manipulation of resources)</li>
<li>It has Self-descriptive messages</li>
<li>It supports multiple forms of presentation (hypermedia as the engine of application state)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <mark>REST is not a specific protocol or specification, but a style philosophy</mark>. While REST defines rules and principles such as the identification of resources, unified interfaces, stateless communication, etc., it does not prescribe a specific protocol or specification.
it does not prescribe a specific way to implement them. As a result, in practice, different teams may have different understandings and practices, leading to inconsistencies and portability of the API.
This leads to inconsistency and reduced maintainability of the API.</p>
<p>In addition, REST has a number of limitations and drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all requests can be described by resources, such as the login (<code>/login</code>) operation, which is very convoluted when converted to <code>session</code>;
The same problem arises for operations like money transfers, where the limited number of HTTP verbs cannot support all business scenarios.</li>
<li>REST does not provide a clear solution to the inevitable problems such as paging, specific structure of the return body, error handling and authentication, etc.</li>
<li>For complex queries (such as Search Search), the query parameters of the RESTful API can become very complex and difficult to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, although the REST style is a good guideline, the specific implementation needs to be combined with specific business requirements and technical features to make some trade-offs in order to achieve a good API design.
Finally, do we need a Web API design specification that follows the REST style? I think REST can solve 90% of the problems, but there is still 10% need to specify the details.</p>
<h2 id="web-api-specification-multiple-choice-questions">Web API specification multiple choice questions</h2>
<p>Since our protocol is based on HTTP and REST design, we will base our discussion on the four core parts of an HTTP request: URL, Header, Request and Response.
These are: URL, Header, Request and Response.</p>
<h3 id="url-best-practices">URL Best Practices</h3>
<p>My inspiration for URL design came from <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">Ruby on Rails</a>.
Before that, I always instinctively put model information on top of URLs, but in reality good URL design should be a plan for the information structure of the system.
Therefore, URL design should consider not only the API, but also the user-oriented Web URL.</p>
<p>To achieve good URL design, I have summarized the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate resources (this answers the question of whether paging should be in the Header)</li>
<li>Self-explanatory (readable, the URL itself contains the core information)</li>
<li>Security (can not contain user authentication information, OAuth spent a lot of effort to understand this, anti-forgery)</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, the URL model is as follows:</p>
<p><code>/$(prefix)/$(module)/$(model)/$(sub-model)/$(verb)?$(query)#${fragment}</code></p>
<p>where Prefix may be the version of the API, or it may be a special qualification, as some companies rely on for access layer triage;
Module is a business module, which can also be omitted; Model is a model; SubModel is a submodel, which can be omitted;
Verb is a verb, which can also be omitted; Query is a request parameter; Fragment is an HTTP primitive Fragment.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all components are required to appear. For example, fields such as SubModel and Verb can
be allowed to be hidden in different URL styles.</p>

<p><strong>Version advantage in URLs</strong></p>
<p>We follow the principle of consistency when designing URLs; the same URL is used to access the same resource, regardless of identity or state.
This is also the basic principle of Uniform Resource Location. While we can accept different content formats (e.g. JSON / YAML / HTML / PDF / etc.)
but we want the location of the resource to be unique.</p>
<p>However, the question is, should the same resource be reflected in the URL for rendering between versions? This depends on whether the designer considers versioning to be in the realm of location information.</p>
<p>According to the RFC design, in addition to the URL there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URN (Uniform Resource Name)</a>.
The latter is used to identify the resource, while the URL points to the resource address. In practice, URNs are not so widely used that URIs are almost equivalent to URLs.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Verb is not enough</strong></p>
<p>In REST design, we need to operate on resources using HTTP verbs like GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / PATCH / HEAD.
For example, using the API <code>GET /apis/books</code> to view book listings is natural and reasonable.
However, when it comes to performing an action like &ldquo;borrow a book
we don&rsquo;t have a suitable verb (BORROW) to represent it. In this case, there are two possible options:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the POST method with a custom verb, such as <code>POST /apis/books/borrow</code>, for the action of borrowing a book;</li>
<li>creating a book borrow log, using a resource add method to structure the non-existent action, e.g. <code>POST /apis/books/borrow-log/</code>;</li>
</ol>
<p>This issue comes up a lot in complex scenarios such as user login (<code>POST /api/auth/login</code> vs <code>POST /api/session</code>) and account transfers (vs transfer record creation), etc.
<mark>API abstract or concrete, there is always an explanation of the business. </mark> We can&rsquo;t simply generalize all of our business to CRUD.
Rather, we need to divide the business wisely to make it clearer and more understandable to users.</p>
<p>When designing, we can consider whether we need to create a corresponding button for each API to make it easier for users to do so.
If there is only one API named <code>/api/do</code> and all the services are bound to it, although technically possible, this design does not meet the business requirements.
Each layer of abstraction is designed to standardize the solution to a particular problem, and the TCP L7 design is a reflection of this philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Readable Stable Identity explained</strong></p>
<p>When marking a resource, we typically have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ID: IDs are usually bound to database self-incrementing IDs.</li>
<li>Use a GUID: such as a UUID, although less precise.</li>
<li>Use Readable Stable Identity: Usually identified by name, UID, or a specific ID such as a host name, IP address, or serial number.
This identifier is required to be stable and globally unique, which is useful in internal systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a personal design tip: use a slug of the form <code>${type}/${type-id}</code> to describe an identifier.
For example <code>hostname/abc.sqa</code> or <code>ip/172.133.2.1</code>.
This design approach provides a good balance between readability and uniqueness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A slug is a human-readable, unique identifier, used to identify a resource instead of a less human-readable identifier like an id .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://itnext.io/whats-a-slug-f7e74b6c23e0">What&rsquo;s a slug. and why would I use one? | by Dave Sag</a></p>
<p>PS: At the end of the article I&rsquo;ll also introduce an Apple Music solution that combines the ID / Readable / Stable features.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of one-level and multi-level</strong></p>
<p>The hierarchical design of URLs can be based on modeling, or a straightforward single-level structure can be used. specific problem solving approach.
For example, when designing user-owned books, one can choose a multi-level structure <code>/api/users/foo/books</code> or a one-level structure <code>/api/books?owner=foo</code>.</p>
<p>Both options are technically possible, <mark>the former respecting the attribution of the model, and the latter focusing on the simplicity of the URL structure</mark>.</p>
<p>A multi-level structure is more intuitive, but also needs to address the issue of possible multiple ways of organization, such as books in a library organized by author or category?
In this case, consider making the attribution of models explicit in a multi-level structure
For example <code>/api/author/foo/books</code> (based on authors) or <code>/api/category/computer/books</code> (based on categories).</p>
<p><strong>Alias URL explanation</strong></p>
<p>For some frequently used URLs, although they can be designed according to URL rules, we can still design a more concise URL that
to facilitate user presentation and use. This design is especially common for Web URLs. For example, the API for a library&rsquo;s most popular books:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Original URL
https://test.com/apis/v3/books?sort=hot&amp;limit=10

# Alias URL
https://test.com/apis/v3/books/hot
</code></pre><p><strong>Model abbreviations explained</strong></p>
<p>Often, when modeling resources, longer names are used to name them, for example a book index might be named <code>BookIndex</code> instead of <code>Index</code>.
When rendering in URLs, since the URL prefix of <code>/book/book-index</code> contains Book, we can reduce the layer of description and
We can make the URL more concise, for example by using <code>/book/index</code>. This technique is very common in Web URL design.</p>
<p>There is also a strategy of model abbreviation, which provides a complete set of alias registration schemes. aliases that are globally unique.
For example, in Kubernetes, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.26/#deployment-v1-apps">Deployment</a>
is a common naming, while <code>apps/v1/Deployment</code> is the full name by adding a Group restriction.
There is also a shorthand for <code>deploy</code>. This mechanism relies on Kubernetes&rsquo; API Schema system for registration and work.</p>
<h3 id="header-best-practices">Header Best Practices</h3>
<p>We often overlook the importance of the Header. In fact, the selection of HTTP verbs, HTTP status codes, and various authentication logic (e.g., cookies / Basic Auth / Berear Token) all depend on the design of the Header.

<p><strong>About only using POST</strong></p>
<p>Some novices (or those who consider themselves experienced) may come to the erroneous conclusion that, with the exception of GET requests
all HTTP requests should use the POST method. Some even demand that <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/336797348">all actions (even read-only requests) should use the POST method</a>.
This argument is often supported on the grounds of &ldquo;simple consistency&rdquo;, &ldquo;cache avoidance&rdquo;, or &ldquo;operator requirements&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, it is important to understand the original design of the HTTP method: it is used to describe the type of resource manipulation that gives rise to a number of issues including caching, security, and idempotency.
In relatively simple scenarios, omitting this layer of abstraction really doesn&rsquo;t pose much of a problem, but once you get into the complexities of the domain, the
Using this layer of abstraction for HTTP methods becomes very important. <mark>Whether this follows the standard or not will determine whether you get the benefits of standardization</mark>.
The analogy is like a new phone manufacturer that can choose not to use the USB TypeC interface.
It&rsquo;s technically possible, but it also loses a lot of standardization support and mental agreement.</p>
<p>I especially like one <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/huixiong-19">Knowing user</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/336797348/answer/2198634068">comment</a>: &ldquo;<mark>Routing hasn&rsquo;t gone away, it&rsquo;s just shifted</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>2XX family</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of HTTP status codes is to indicate the result of communication between the client and the server. 2XX status code family means that the server has successfully received, understood, and processed the client request,
understood and processed the client request, and the response was successful. The following are common status codes in the 2XX family and their meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 OK: The request was processed successfully and the server returned a response.</li>
<li>201 Created: The request has been successfully processed and a new resource has been created on the server.</li>
<li>202 Accepted: The request has been accepted by the server, but not yet executed. This status code is typically used for asynchronous processing.</li>
<li>204 No Content: The request was processed successfully, but the server did not return any response body content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2XX family of status codes indicates that the request has been successfully processed. These status codes let the client know explicitly that the request has been processed correctly so that it can proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>The need to use the 2XX family of status codes across the board depends on whether the client needs to be explicitly/displayed with information that
inform it of the next action. If it has been clearly described by other means (including documentation, verbal agreements)
then it is indeed possible to use 200 status codes across the board for return. But passing meaning based on behavior.
or document-based (or even verbal)? Is it more complex or more concise?</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of paging methods</strong></p>
<p>The two most common types of paging we see are Page-based and Offset-based, which can be mapped by formula.
In addition, there exists a method called Continuation Token, which is similar in technique to Oracle&rsquo;s
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/241622/paging-with-oracle">rownum paging scheme</a>, using the parameter <code>start-from=? </code> to describe it.
While the advantages and disadvantages of Continuation Token are significant, using this approach allows sequential to be used as an alternative to random.</p>
<p><strong>Paging controls interpretation</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we need to distinguish between Client Pagination and Server Pagniation.
Client Pagination means that the parameters of the next page are calculated by the client, while Server Pagination is a protocol such as <code>rel</code> or JSON.API returned by the server.
Using Server Pagniation avoids some problems, such as bulk blocking of some content, which may result in missing pages or white screens if client-side paging is used.</p>

<p><strong>Several forms of models</strong></p>
<p>In API design, there are several definitions for how models should be represented. Although this is not a topic that must be discussed in the API specification, it is very important for API design.</p>
<p>I have divided the model presentation that models are often described into the following categories, which are not professionally defined and borrow some definitions from the Java context below.
These names will be called differently in different companies and even different teams:</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202304/models.png" alt="models"  />


</p>
<p><small>image by alswl</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Business Object (BO): the original business model</li>
<li>Data Object (DO): the model stored to the RDBMS, so it must be a flat field structure, sometimes a BO will correspond to multiple DOs</li>
<li>View Object (VO): the model presented to the presentation layer, only keep the information the user needs to see, such as sensitive information will be removed</li>
<li>Data Transfer Object (DTO): the model used to transfer in the RPC system, generally not much different from the original Model, depending on the different serialization systems will have differences
(such as the handling of enumerations)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two other categories are often used: Rich Model and Tiny Model (please ignore the naming, it varies a lot from team to team):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Model: This model is used to describe a rich model, which contains almost all the data needed and allows nesting of sub-resources.</li>
<li>Tiny Model: is a compact model, often used in the list API to be used</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linking, sidecar, and embedding of models</strong></p>
<p>In API design, we often need to deal with cases where a model contains multiple submodels, such as a Book containing Comments.

<p>There are some other issues that are not converged in the four elements, but we often encounter them in engineering practice, and I will run them out:</p>
<p>**I&rsquo;m not in the HTTP protocol, what should I do? ** I&rsquo;m not in the HTTP protocol, what should I do?</p>
<p>Non-HTTP protocols are less commonly encountered in Web APIs, and the cost of creating a new set of protocols is too high. There are protocols that are introduced in certain areas.
For example, <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> in the IoT domain.</p>
<p>In addition, RPC is a wide-ranging concept that goes far beyond the protocol level.
Often we compare the transport protocols of HTTP and RPC, as well as serialization protocols.
I believe that much of the discussion in this paper is also of importance to the RPC community.</p>
<p>Some teams or individuals plan to use protocols that they create themselves, but my opinion is that self-built protocols should be avoided as much as possible, because it is very rare that there is a real need to create a protocol.
If a strong need does exist, then I would ask two questions: Have you read through the HTTP RFC document and the HTTP/2 RFC document?</p>
<p>**I&rsquo;m not a remote service (RPC / HTTP etc.), but what about the SDK? ** This article focuses on Web APIs (RPC/ HTTP etc.).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the design specifications of the Web API (HTTP) and some of the rules can be applied to RPC systems.
However, the basis of the discussion is based on Remote Service.
If you are an SDK developer, you will have two roles, possibly as a client communicating with a remote server, and as an SDK providing developer-oriented services.
You will also provide developer-facing interfaces as an SDK. For the latter, the following specifications can be used as a reference:</p>
<p>For the latter, you can refer to these specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure SDK Design Specifications <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_design.html">General Guidelines: API Design | Azure SDKs</a></li>
<li>Posix API examples (e.g. File <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Low_002dLevel-I_002fO.html">Low-Level I/O (The GNU C Library)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authentication Authentication Scheme</strong></p>
<p>In general, the Web API design will clearly describe the authentication and authentication system to be used.
It is important to distinguish between the concepts of &ldquo;authentication&rdquo; and &ldquo;authentication&rdquo;. The topic of &ldquo;authentication&rdquo; can be discussed in a separate section, so this paper will not cover this aspect.</p>
<p>In Web API design, common authentication methods include HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth2, and account password login.
In addition, HMac algorithm-based anti-replay and anti-tampering schemes are used for anti-tampering.</p>
<p><strong>Overlooked Topics</strong></p>
<p>In this discussion, I did not cover the following topics: asynchronous protocols (Web Sockets / Long Pulling / Round Trials), CORS, and security issues.
Although these topics are important, they will not be covered in this article.</p>
<p><strong>When to break the rules</strong></p>
<p>Some developers believe that rules are there to be broken. The reality is often so complex that it is difficult to discuss the details.
If a developer feels that a rule does not meet the actual need, there are two ways to handle it: change the rule or break it.
However, I prefer to discuss and update the rules, clarify where the specification is inadequate, and determine if there are special cases.
If a special case does need to be created, be sure to describe it in detail in the documentation, informing the successor and the consumer that it is a special case, explaining why the special case was created and how the special case responds.</p>

<p>Github&rsquo;s API is one that I often refer to. It models its business domain very clearly, provides thorough documentation, and makes communication much less costly.
I mainly refer to the following two links:
API Definition <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">GitHub REST API documentation</a> and
a list of application-oriented APIs [Endpoints available for GitHub Apps](<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps">https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps</a>? apiVersion=2022-11-28)
This list includes almost all of Github&rsquo;s APIs.</p>

<h3 id="azure-style">Azure style</h3>
<p>Azure&rsquo;s API design follows [api-guidelines/Guidelines.md at master - microsoft/api-guidelines](<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/">https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/</a> master/Guidelines.md).
This article is schematic, and there is also a practical guide at [Best practices in cloud applications](<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/index">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/index</a> -best-practices)
and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design">Web API design best practices</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Azure&rsquo;s product line is much richer than Github, and some APIs do not follow Azure&rsquo;s own specifications.
When looking for examples, I mainly refer to
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/?view=Azure">REST API Browser</a>, the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/">Azure Storage REST API Reference</a>.
If the specific implementation conflicts with the Guidelines.md, I will use the Guidelines.md conclusion.</p>

<p>The overall design style of Azure is more complex than the Github API, and there are multiple versions of the same product, making it a little less uniform.
It looks a little less uniform. It is also more difficult to have a single specification that binds all teams in this complex scenario.
We can see that the Azaure team is working on the Guidelines, and they are recently launching the vNext specification.</p>
<h3 id="my-personal-style">My personal style</h3>
<p>My personal style is basically inherited from the Github API style, with some minor adjustments to make it more suitable for small and medium-sized product development.
The reasons for my changes are explained in the notes, and the starting point for changes is: simplify / reduce ambiguity / consider the actual cost. If &ldquo;Note&rdquo; is marked in the notes, it follows the Github scheme and adds some ideas.</p>

<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="/images/202304/apple-music.png" alt="Apple Music"  />


</p>
<p><small>image from Apple Music</small></p>
<p>I was recently using Apple Music and noticed the URL structure of its web page:</p>
<p><code>/cn/album/we-sing-we-dance-we-steal-things/277635758?l=en</code></p>
<p>Looking closely at this URL structure, I can see that the Path contains human-readable slug in three parts: <code>alumn/$(name)/$(id)</code> (which contains the ID).
A question immediately occurred to me: are the intermediate readable names machine-sensitive and purely geared towards natural humans?
So I tested a fabricated address: <code>/cn/album/foobar/277635758?l=en</code>.
Can you guess if the result is accessible before you try to access it?</p>
<p>This design paradigm is a bit more complex than my current common URL design specification. My specification requires that the resource locale be organized using a two-level slug, <code>$(type)/$(id)</code>.
Whereas Apple uses <code>$(type)/(type-id)/$(id)</code>, taking care of both readability and accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="off-topic---why-graphql-doesnt-work">Off-Topic - Why GraphQL Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h2>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a way to request APIs by using a custom query language, which has the advantage of providing a more flexible way to fetch data.
Compared to RESTful APIs that require a single request for all the data needed, GraphQL allows the client to explicitly specify the data needed, thus reducing unnecessary data transfer and processing.</p>
<p>However, GraphQL&rsquo;s over-flexibility is also one of its drawbacks. Since it does not have some specifications for modeling business scenarios like the REST API, developers need to think about data processing themselves.
developers need to think about how to handle the data themselves.
This can lead to unreasonable query requests that can put excessive pressure on the back-end database. In addition, GraphQL has relatively few implementations and documentation, which also requires more learning costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, while GraphQL can provide better results in some specific scenarios, it is not suitable for all API design needs.
In fact, some companies have even chosen to drop support for GraphQL, such as Github&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-18-deprecation-notice-graphql-for-packages/">some projects</a>.</p>

Once established, however, rules can effectively reduce the complexity of the system, avoiding increasing complexity over time and as the business progresses, and reducing communication costs on the R&amp;D side.</p>

<p>Static typing is becoming more and more popular.
Several languages born after 2010, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc., have gone the static typing route.
Some of the previously popular dynamic languages (Python, PHP, JavaScript) are also actively introducing new language features (Type Hint, TypeScript) to enhance static typing.</p>
<p>Having worked on larger projects in Python, I have experienced the difficulties that dynamic languages pose when projects get large:
The cost of code regression during the refactoring phase was unusually high, and much of the historical code was afraid to move.
Then the technology stack shifted to Java, and being embraced by the type system made people feel safe.</p>
<p>In the last year, I have been working on a stability-oriented operation and maintenance system. Python was used at the beginning of the system selection.
I pushed Python 3.7 in the project and used Python&rsquo;s type system on a large scale to mitigate potential risks.</p>
<p>Going back to my roots, I spent some time learning about Python&rsquo;s design and implementation of the type system.
This article is a PEP proposal that describes how far Python has come with the type system.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2 id="type-systems">Type Systems</h2>
<p>Before we talk about type systems, we need to clarify two concepts, dynamic languages and dynamic types.</p>
<p>A dynamic programming language is a program that can change its structure at runtime.
This structure can include functions, objects, variable types, and program structures.
Dynamic types are one type of Type System, i.e., programs that can modify variable types during runtime.
The other type is the static type: the variable type is determined at compile time and is not allowed to change at runtime.
Another division of the type system is strong and weak types, where strong types are instructions that forbid type mismatches and weak types vice versa.</p>
<p>The two concepts, dynamic languages and dynamic types, have different entry points.
Python is a dynamic language and a dynamically typed language, or a strongly typed dynamic type.
This article will focus on the type system of the Python language and will not cover dynamic language features.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-type-safety">The road to type safety</h2>
<p>There is an ongoing debate within the industry about which is more powerful: dynamic or static types.
Proponents of static types see advantages in three areas: performance, error discovery, and efficient refactoring.
Static types can significantly improve runtime efficiency by determining the concrete type at compile time;
The ability to detect errors at compile time, especially when projects get progressively larger;
The type system can help the IDE to prompt for efficient refactoring.
Proponents of dynamic typing argue that analyzing code is simpler, less error-prone, and faster to write.</p>
<p>Python developers have not failed to see this pain point.
A series of PEP proposals were created.
The type system was introduced to Python through syntax and feature enhancements while retaining the benefits of Python&rsquo;s dynamic type system.</p>
<p>Python proposed PEP 484 in 2014, followed by a refined version of PEP 483 (The Theory of Type Hints).
Its project implementation, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module, was released in 3.5.
After several iterations of PEP 484, PEP 526, PEP 544, PEP 586, PEP 589, and PEP 591, Python&rsquo;s type system has become very rich.
It even includes relatively rare features like Structural Subtyping and Literal Typing.</p>
<h3 id="pep-483---core-concepts">PEP 483 - Core Concepts</h3>
<p>Released in December 2014, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/">PEP 483</a>
This is a concise version of the core concepts Guido wrote, making clear the direction, boundaries, do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of building a type system for Python.</p>
<p>PEP 483 does not talk about concrete engineering implementations, but rather outlines how the Python type system is presented to the public.
Define the Type/Class difference, the former being a syntactic analysis concept and the latter a runtime concept.
Under this definition, a Class is a Type, but a Type is not necessarily a Class.
For example, <code>Union[str, int]</code> is a Type but not a Class.</p>
<p>PEP 483 also introduces built-in base types: <code>Any</code> / <code>Unison</code> / <code>Optional</code> / <code>Tuple</code> / <code>Callable</code>, which support rich upstream variations.</p>
<p>The biggest criticism of the static type system is that it is not flexible enough, and the Go language does not implement generics yet.
PEP 483 introduces the use of Python Generic types in a generic
The form is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TypeVar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;S&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">longest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">first</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">second</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">second</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, PEP 483 also mentions some important minor features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alias Alias</li>
<li>Farward Reference (use definition class in definition class method annotations), eg.: solves the problem of needing to reference a Node in a binary tree Node node</li>
<li>covariance contravariant</li>
<li>Use annotations to mark types</li>
<li>Transformation Cast</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of PEP 483 relies heavily on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">PEP 3107 &ndash; Function Annotations</a>.
This proposal. PEP 3107 introduces the use of function annotations. For example, <code>func(a: a1, b: b1) -&gt; r1</code>This code, thewhere the descriptors after the colon are recorded in the <code>__annotations__</code> variable of func.</p>
<p>PEP 3107 shows the effect as follows, where you can clearly see that the function variables are stored:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">add</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__annotations__</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># {&#39;x&#39;: int, &#39;y&#39;: int, &#39;return&#39;: int}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>PS: Python now has Decorator decorators / Annotation annotations, where Annotation is also designed with the same name as Java&rsquo;s Annotation, a potpourri.</p>
<h3 id="pep-484---type-hints-core">PEP 484 - Type Hints Core</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">PEP 484 &ndash; Type Hints</a>
A complete description of how the Python type system is designed, how it is used, and what the details are (typing modules), building on PEP 483</p>
<p>This proposal begins by stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory,
even by convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one sentence, the proposal eliminates the possibility of Python evolving to a static system at the language level.</p>
<p>In addition to the features already explained in PEP 483, the proposal also appeals to me in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow adding type descriptions to already existing libraries via Stub Files. Specifically, the typed signature of Python code is described using the <code>.pyi</code> file corresponding to the Python file.
This scheme is similar to TS&rsquo;s <code>@types</code> file.</li>
<li>Allowing type overloading with <code>@overload</code> is a long time coming, and Python can actually (in a sense) support overloading.</li>
<li>Introduces typing implementation details, such as using abs (Abstract Base Class) to build interfaces for common types, including <code>Sized</code> / <code>Iterable</code> base interfaces.
Personally, I think this is actually quite a lot of work, and is a way to sort out the dependencies of existing classes.</li>
<li>Python backward (Python 2) compatible methods are introduced, and there are several strategies:
Using decorator (<code>@typehints(foo=str, returns=str)</code>), comments, Stub files, Docstring</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pep-526---variables-are-also-arranged">PEP 526 - Variables are also arranged</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/">PEP 526 - Syntax for Variable Annotations</a>
The core proposal is to add Type Hints support to variables.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>function annotation</code>, it is also stored by annotation.
The difference is that instead of adding a <code>__annotations__</code> member to the instance, the annotations information for the variable is stored in the context variable <code>__annotations__</code>.
This is actually quite understandable: when a variable type is defined, the variable is not yet initialized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write a demo to demonstrate this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">List</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">users</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># print(__annotations__)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># {&#39;users&#39;: typing.List[int]}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the above demo has the effect of creating a <code>users</code> in the context variable, but this <code>users</code> doesn&rsquo;t actually exist, it just defines the type.
If you run <code>print(users)</code> it will throw <code>NameError: name 'users' is not defined</code>.</p>
<p>It is clearer to look at the bytecode:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> L.   1         0  SETUP_ANNOTATIONS

 L.   1         2  LOAD_CONST               0
                4  LOAD_CONST               (&#39;List&#39;,)
                6  IMPORT_NAME              typing
                8  IMPORT_FROM              List
               10  STORE_NAME               List
               12  POP_TOP

 L.   3        14  LOAD_NAME                List
               16  LOAD_NAME                int
               18  BINARY_SUBSCR
               20  LOAD_NAME                __annotations__
               22  LOAD_STR                 &#39;users&#39;
               24  STORE_SUBSCR
               26  LOAD_CONST               None
               28  RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre><p>As you can clearly see, instead of creating a variable named users, the <code>__annotations__</code> variable is used.
Note: Python stores variables using the opcode <code>STORE_NAME</code>.</p>
<p>PS: There are a number of rejected proposals in this proposal, which is quite interesting, and the community has come up with a lot of strange and clever ideas.
You can see the caution of the community decision, the difficulty of upgrading the stock system.</p>
<h3 id="pep-544---nominal-subtyping-vs-structural-subtyping">PEP 544 - Nominal Subtyping vs Structural Subtyping</h3>
<p>The type system discussed in PEP 484 is Nominal Subtyping.
This <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/">PEP 544 &ndash; Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)</a>
This <a href="">PEP 544 &ndash; Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)</a> is proposed for Structural subtyping.If I had to translate it, I think it could be called named subtypes / isomorphic subtypes.
Note that some people also refer to Structural Subtyping as Duck Typing, but the two are not the same, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#Structural_type_systems">Duck typing / Comparison with other type systems</a>.</p>
<p>Nominal Subtyping refers to matching types literally, while Structural Subtyping matches by structure (behavior).
For example, Go&rsquo;s Type is a Structural Subtyping implementation.</p>
<p>Here is a simple demo to demonstrate the latter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Iterator</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Iterable</span>

<h3 id="pep-586--pep-589--pep-591-continuous-enhancement">PEP 586 / PEP 589 / PEP 591 Continuous enhancement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0586/">PEP 586 &ndash; Literal Types</a>
The Python 3.8 implementation supports the use of literals as types.
For example <code>Literal[4]</code>, and for a more semantic example <code>Literal['GREEN']</code>.</p>
<p>My first thought was that this is very similar to Symbol in Scala, which is written as <code>Symbol(&quot;GREEN&quot;)</code>.
This feature is quite collegial and easy to write in the DSL.Scala officials have said that the Symbol feature may be removed in the future, so it is recommended to use constants instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/">PEP 589 &ndash; TypedDict: Type Hints for Dictionaries with a Fixed Set of Keys</a>
Add a Type of key to Dict, inheriting from <code>TypedDict</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591/">PEP 591 &ndash; Adding a final qualifier to typing</a>
Add the concepts of <code>final</code> / <code>Final</code>, the former is a decorator, the latter is an annotation that marks the class/function/variable as unmodifiable.</p>
<p>At this point, Python 3.8 has the type system features we need every day (not at runtime 😂).</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the <code>typing</code> module is clearly marked in the documentation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools
such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Namely, the Python runtime (Intercepter / Code Evaluator) does not support type decorators for functions and variables.
These decorators can only be checked by third-party tools, such as type checkers, IDEs, statics, and Linter.</p>
<p>This information illustrates the limitations of Python&rsquo;s attempts at type safety. All the restrictions, constraints, and limitations don&rsquo;t happen at runtime.
The only way to harvest engineering-above-board value from the type system is to use third-party tools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the Python community is trying to move closer to a type system, but how far can this non-language level Runtime support go?
Python lacks a golden father, and its godfather Red Hat has limited resources to invest. Even the community hasn&rsquo;t finished switching from Python 2 to Python 3 yet, so why?
The input/output ratio is too low, the new features are not attractive enough, and there are too many alternatives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, look at the competition:
Dynamic languages are moving closer to static languages, and static languages are absorbing features from dynamic languages. For example, the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in Java 14.
Kotlin / Scala and other languages Type Inference.
Perhaps this evolution is more acceptable to users.</p>
