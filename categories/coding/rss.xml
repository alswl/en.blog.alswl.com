<p>Using GitOps to manage delivery content is a common DevOps practice. We use Git for version control and Git tags to track the versions of deployed software. While this may seem to work, the concept of versioning is far from that simple in the age of cloud-native technology.</p>
<h2 id="the-version-problem">The Version Problem</h2>
<p>After introducing GitOps into the DevOps workflow, we can leverage GitOps for continuous integration and continuous delivery. GitOps addresses three core concerns: <strong>content</strong>, <strong>version</strong>, and <strong>collaboration</strong>. Yet we often focus on content and overlook version management.</p>
<p>What version-management issues need to be solved in a GitOps process?</p>
<p>A complete GitOps solution includes content description (Manifest), build strategy (Builder), and application strategy (Applier). Content description has given rise to many description languages, from traditional <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> / <a href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra">Chef</a> to cloud and cloud-native favourites like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a>, and <a href="https://kustomize.io/">Kustomize</a>. With so many ways to describe content, pinning down an application’s version becomes very complex.</p>
<p>When we talk about version, do we <mark>mean the version of the application source code, the version of an image, or the version of an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) repository</mark>? Furthermore, when releasing a set of related applications—e.g. frontend and backend, or a system made of multiple backend apps—how do we clearly describe the <mark>version dependencies</mark> between them?</p>
<p>Inaccurate versioning leads to problems such as wrong release versions, tangled application dependencies, and inability to roll back.</p>
<p>Many teams handle this vaguely: ship the latest version, deploy backend before frontend. In a complex product team or one that must maintain multiple stable versions, this rough approach is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Version management addresses not only <mark>version identification</mark> but also <mark>dependencies</mark> between applications. GitOps version management therefore needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to build artifacts delivered to customers, how to define their versions, and how to present all versions.</li>
<li>How to resolve version dependencies when a set of software has them.</li>
<li>How to describe a system when a set of software forms one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version management is important for any delivered product. We will break down this topic step by step and move from the original questions to GitOps version-management best practices.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-introduction-to-gitops">A Brief Introduction to GitOps</h2>
<p>Before going further, here is a short overview of GitOps so we share the same understanding of key concepts.</p>
<p>The core idea of GitOps is <mark>infrastructure as code (IaC)</mark>: using declarative descriptions instead of imperative ones. IaC content is usually based on some paradigm that describes the desired state of a target. That paradigm can be Terraform, Kubernetes YAML, <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>, or even Ansible. The target can be cloud services, Kubernetes, or physical machines. In short, by using YAML instead of Bash scripts, we can greatly improve the accuracy and controllability of changes.</p>
<p>For GitOps, whether you use Git is not the main point; you could use SVN. Git is simply more widely used and fits well with team collaboration and CI/CD. With a Git repository, you also get versioning based on Git revision / tag / branch, which in practice means version history and managing multiple versions in parallel.</p>
<p>Describing things only by Git revision is still not enough for real-world needs.</p>
<h2 id="the-root-of-the-problem--versions-of-binaries-and-startup-config">The Root of the Problem — Versions of Binaries and Startup Config</h2>
<p>When we trace versions to their source, the most primitive version is the version of the code.</p>
<p>What is the version of the code? Is it the version in the code repository or the version of the application built from that code? This version is not the version in the version-control system (e.g. Git / Mercurial / SVN). Although the two are often related, the code itself is just a set of files; once a build succeeds, there is a version. If it is not defined, the version is unknown and not tied to the repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: From here on we do not distinguish between Git / Mercurial / SVN; we use Git as the stand-in for all of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also note that in Chinese there are two concepts (库 Library and 仓库 Repository). In neither case does it imply that a “library” must be a versioned (Git/SVN) repository—we are not assuming code is always under version control. When we pack source files into a zip (e.g. GitHub’s zip download), that zip is still a codebase even if it has lost all Git history.</p>
<p>The version of the code is effectively the <mark>version of the application</mark>, as intended by the author. It is usually in the form <code>vx.y.z</code> rather than a Git commit hash, and the most common approach is <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend storing the version in a <code>VERSION</code> file in the code tree. For example, Git’s <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/GIT-VERSION-GEN">Version</a> file clearly shows the current version:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>GVF=GIT-VERSION-FILE
DEF_VER=v2.42.GIT
</code></pre><p>The <code>.GIT</code> suffix indicates the code is in development mode. If we switch to a release, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.39.3/GIT-VERSION-GEN">v2.39.3</a>, we see <code>DEF_VER=v2.39.3</code>, a standard artifact version. Two best practices here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a file to store the source version.</li>
<li>The version file in source is always in <code>dev</code> mode; it becomes an official version only after a release tag.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the source is not only binaries, executables, and dynamic libraries (<code>.dll</code> / <code>.so</code> / <code>.dylib</code>) but also the corresponding startup configuration files. These configs are usually managed together with the version—e.g. Nginx’s <code>nginx.conf</code> and Redis’s <code>redis.conf</code> should be under version control.</p>
<p>What is built from the source repository is the <strong>artifact</strong>. Artifacts already have two versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source version, i.e. the version defined in the <code>VERSION</code> file.</li>
<li>Source repository version, i.e. Git revision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="artifact-version-management">Artifact Version Management</h2>
<p>With artifact version management, things get more complex because artifacts introduce more questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an artifact and what does it consist of? (Answered above.)</li>
<li>How is an artifact installed? What is the installer and what is the runtime?</li>
<li>How is artifact information managed centrally? How is data managed?</li>
<li>Do artifacts depend on each other? How are dependencies and version constraints handled?</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of artifact is central. One key idea: <mark>artifacts can be turned into new artifacts by packers</mark>.</p>
<p>Because artifacts have versions and new artifacts get new versions, we end up with multiple layers. To avoid losing the original version, we extend the notion of version to <mark>Upstream Version</mark>—the version assigned by the software author, the source of all versions.</p>
<p>Why can one artifact become another? Consider containers in Kubernetes. A container is a delivery format: it puts the executable and startup config into an image that can run in a container environment. The image in a registry is itself an artifact.</p>
<p>Helm / Kustomize are also delivery formats (packaging toolchains). Each layer solves a specific problem and can run in a given environment (e.g. container, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure).</p>
<p>Every artifact is built and has its own <mark>packaging info</mark>, which can change and thus add another version. In practice we want the artifact’s version tied to its upstream version. Each packaging mechanism may have its own config but should still follow the upstream version. For example, a Kubernetes Workload references an image; the Workload description is extra info, while the image remains under upstream control.</p>
<p><mark>Artifact + Packaging Info = New Artifact</mark>. Artifacts are packed into new artifacts until the final installer deploys them into the target environment.</p>
<p>When these artifacts can be described in files (IaC), we get various IaC repositories, which are the core objects of GitOps.</p>
<h2 id="concepts-at-a-glance">Concepts at a Glance</h2>
<p>Here is a concise map of these concepts:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Chinese</th>
          <th>English</th>
          <th>Explanation</th>

          <td>Source Code Repo</td>
          <td>The unit of version control that holds the source code</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>版本</td>
          <td>Version</td>
          <td>Application version corresponding to the source; human-defined, semantic; sometimes called Upstream Version</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>可执行文件</td>
          <td>Executable File</td>
          <td>Build output, usually an ELF executable or a library</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>启动配置文件</td>
          <td>Configuration File</td>
          <td>Startup config for the ELF/Lib, distinct from general config (e.g. Kubernetes YAML)</td>

          <td>制品</td>
          <td>Artifact</td>
          <td>A set of executable + startup config that can run in a runtime; usually file-based; artifacts can nest other artifacts</td>

          <td>Installer</td>
          <td>Tool that installs the artifact into the runtime</td>

      <tr>

          <td>Runtime</td>

      <tr>
          <td>打包附属信息</td>
          <td>Packaging Info</td>
          <td>Extra info needed when packing, e.g. container OS, process resources, default env vars</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Together these concepts form the core of artifact version management and help us manage and trace versions and their relationships.</p>
<h3 id="packer">Packer</h3>
<p>A packer is a tool that turns artifacts into a specific format via packaging (compile, link, merge, archive, etc.), producing a new artifact. Its input is usually upstream—either source code or artifacts produced by another system.</p>
<p>For example, when packaging Docker Compose, the input is images; for Helm, the input includes images, startup config, and Helm templates, and the output is YAML.</p>
<h3 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h3>
<p>An artifact is a collection of data that can run in a given environment. It is made of executables and startup config, usually as files, and runs in a runtime. Artifacts can nest other artifacts.</p>
<p>The most common form is a binary (ELF); it can also be something that runs in a specific environment, such as a container image. Artifacts are typically transferred as files.</p>
<h3 id="installer">Installer</h3>
<p>An installer is a tool that puts an artifact into a runtime. It deploys the artifact and ensures it runs. Examples: dpkg, Pacman, or self-extracting installers on Windows. For Kubernetes, we use <code>kubectl</code>; Helm uses the <code>helm</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="linux-community-practice">Linux Community Practice</h2>
<p>Once we understand these concepts, we may notice how close they are to what the Linux community has been doing for years. Setting aside cloud-native buzzwords, the Linux world already had a full solution.</p>
<p>Each layer of artifacts introduces new config / extension / values / env vars—we call all of this <strong>configuration</strong>. This packaging info brings its own challenges at scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proudly using Arch Linux.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="arch-linux-practice">Arch Linux Practice</h3>
<p>Arch Linux uses <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman">Pacman</a> as the package installer and has a full <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_build_system">build system</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a> describes how a package is built; it is a Bash subset and the core file for the package.</p>
<p>For versioning, Arch has a clear scheme and a full <mark>artifact nesting</mark> story. In <code>PKGBUILD</code>, <code>pkgver</code> is the upstream version (with normalisation such as <code>_</code> for <code>-</code> and timestamp format). <code>pkgrel</code> is the release number (not build number); it is incremented on each release to track Arch releases. When most of the <code>PKGBUILD</code> changes, the release number changes. <code>epoch</code> is a last-resort mechanism to force a newer version by breaking version comparison; it defaults to 0 and is hidden.</p>
<p><code>PKGBUILD</code> also uses versioned dependencies to handle modules. For example, the <code>base-devel</code> package depends on 26 base packages, and <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/base-devel/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD">that package itself</a> has <mark>no content</mark>. This avoids introducing a separate model (e.g. Group / Product).</p>
<h2 id="gitops-based-version-management">GitOps-Based Version Management</h2>
<p>Back to GitOps version management: with the analysis above, can we answer the original questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>How are customer-facing artifacts composed, how do we define their version, and how do we present all versions?
<ul>
<li>Use a <code>VERSION</code> file for the software (upstream) version.</li>
<li>Each artifact form has its own version, tied to upstream—e.g. <code>v1.2.3-afe12c</code> for the Git repo, <code>v1.2.3-afe12c-b1</code> for the image build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do we resolve version dependencies within a set of software?
<ul>
<li>Leave this to the installer; the metadata is usually in the packaging info and consumed by the installer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do we represent a system formed by a set of software?
<ul>
<li>Create a new artifact with no upstream version; its content may be empty but it carries packaging and dependency info.</li>
<li>Alternatively, introduce a dedicated concept; that depends on how the packer and installer work together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The wisdom of version management is already present in RPM / DEB / PKGBUILD. We give the application author the right to define version, we allow artifact nesting, and we let versioning span multiple layers.</p>
<p>We want the version of the running artifact to still be derived from the original application (Upstream) version. In large-scale cluster management, it matters that every running program knows where it came from and what it is.</p>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I gave an internal tech talk to my team on best practices for architecture design. I condensed these practices into a &lt;mark&gt;20-character mantra&lt;/mark&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture looks at the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements look at use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design looks at the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details look at the sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared this mantra on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alswl/status/1683778487726006272&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and many friends showed strong interest and wanted to go deeper. So I expanded the ideas from that talk into this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A few days ago, I gave an internal tech talk to my team on best practices for architecture design. I condensed these practices into a <mark>20-character mantra</mark>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Architecture looks at the problem</li>
<li>Requirements look at use cases</li>
<li>Design looks at the model</li>
<li>Details look at the sequence</li>
</ol>
<p>I shared this mantra on <a href="https://twitter.com/alswl/status/1683778487726006272">Twitter</a>, and many friends showed strong interest and wanted to go deeper. So I expanded the ideas from that talk into this article.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-design-and-system-analysis">Architecture Design and System Analysis</h2>
<p>Let’s first clarify <mark>what architecture design and system analysis are</mark> (the latter often shortened to “system analysis”). Some of you are familiar with the first but not the second. No worries—here’s how Wikipedia introduces them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong>: <strong>Software architecture</strong> is an abstract description of the overall structure and components of software, used to guide the design of various aspects of large software systems.</p>
<p><strong>System analysis</strong> aims to study the interactions between parts (subsystems) in a given system structure, the system’s external interfaces and boundaries, and the behavior, functions, and limitations of the system as a whole, so as to provide reference and basis for future changes and related decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The English definitions may make it clearer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture = Software Architecture (design) = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture">Software architecture - Wikipedia</a></li>
<li>System analysis = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis">Systems analysis - Wikipedia</a> + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design">Systems design - Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What we sometimes call “design docs” may cover the whole design process: architecture design, system analysis, and other design activities (communication, PoC, etc.).</p>
<p>Software Architecture (design) = Software Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Define and implement the basic structure and organization of software systems</li>
<li>At the business level: clarify the problem, define concepts, present value</li>
<li>At the technical level: choose foundational frameworks, turn uncertainty into certainty</li>
<li>At the engineering level: identify boundaries, split modules, improve development efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>System Analysis = System Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of analyzing and studying business needs and problems</li>
<li>At the business level: requirement gathering, requirement analysis</li>
<li>At the technical level: modeling, flowcharts, data flow diagrams, interface design</li>
<li>At the engineering level: implementing requirements within applications and system frameworks</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, how I see the boundary between the two: I believe <mark>there is no sharp line between architecture design and system analysis</mark>. Any system or module will go through system analysis. You start thinking in terms of architecture when:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than three teams are collaborating, because that involves interests and boundaries.</li>
<li>You begin to introduce uncertainty, whether actively or passively.</li>
<li>You are making trade-offs: what to do first, what to do next.</li>
<li>The system is so complex that it’s hard to reach consensus and explanation cost rises.</li>
<li>You can provide information others don’t have.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-architecture">What Is Architecture</h2>
<p>Here we focus on <strong>technical</strong> architecture, not business or product architecture. The emphasis is <mark>how to use technical capabilities and methods more efficiently to solve a certain type of problem</mark>.</p>
<p>Technical architecture can be split in two: one is <mark>top-down</mark>—business, strategy, and framework division; the other is <mark>focused on engineering and implementation (coding)</mark>.</p>
<p>Experienced people often have a more macro view. Common terms include: global, macro, domain, strategy, balance, planning. I turned these into a word cloud:</p>
<p>

<p><small>generated by <a href="https://tendcode.com/tool/word-cloud/">https://tendcode.com/tool/word-cloud/</a></small></p>
<p>These concepts matter a lot in architecture design and system analysis, because they help us think about the whole picture and even beyond technology—from business value, commercial strategy, and business strategy.</p>
<p>The other kind of architecture is more about engineering design and implementation. Typical keywords: domain modeling, UML, GoF 23, SOLID, high cohesion and low coupling, etc. Word cloud:</p>

<p>Architecture is a broad topic. This article picks one angle: <mark>making architectural thinking useful in day-to-day work through practice and methodology, to cover about 80% of engineering design and development scenarios</mark>. I call this “architecture design the easy way.”</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-architecture-design--architecture-looks-at-the-problem">Minimalist Architecture Design — Architecture Looks at the Problem</h2>
<p>The first and most important step in understanding architecture is to focus on the <strong>problem</strong>: <mark>what problem are you facing, and how will you solve it?</mark></p>
<p>Usually, if our business and systems run stably and we don’t run into problems, we don’t need much architecture design. But whenever we do architecture design, it’s because we have a problem. The problem may come from new requirements, changes in the environment, or the system’s own evolution. Whatever the source, we have a problem.</p>
<p>After we have a problem, how do we solve it? Like “putting the elephant in the fridge,” we break it into steps.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202307/elephant.png" alt="Putting the elephant in the fridge"  />


</p>
<p><small>image via unknown</small></p>
<p>So solving a problem has three steps: first describe the problem clearly, second negotiate and decide until there is agreement, third take action to solve it.</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202307/q-n-a.png" alt="Problem — Agreement — Action"  />


</p>
<p>One more question that might sound silly: why can’t we just solve the problem directly?</p>
<p>Because problems are complex; there are many solution paths, and different options have different pros, cons, and costs. In architecture design we need to make these decisions.</p>
<p>Then why not just make the decision, or even start coding right away?</p>
<p>First, there may be authority issues—the architect may not have final say; someone with decision rights may need to sign off. Second, the architect may not be an expert in every area; designing a complex system often requires coordinating multiple parts and domain experts to evaluate and decide together.</p>

<p>Take Prometheus’s architecture as an example.</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem: Push or pull for data collection? What storage? How to design the alerting pipeline?</li>
<li>Decisions: Pull (Pushgateway in a few cases); custom TSDB; Alertmanager to integrate with external systems</li>
<li>ROI: Pull reduces observability cost on targets, no need for a push-based registry; no suitable external implementation at the time; Router/Sub alert mechanism for flexible integration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Problems drive architecture change; the architecture addresses the problem; architecture review aligns on the solution.</p>
<p>On who gets to decide: I strongly believe architects should form their own view based on domain knowledge, industry judgment, and understanding of the current situation. That thinking should be supported by cause and effect. <mark>A good architect must have a point of view.</mark></p>
<p>One small add: why didn’t I mention architecture layers or module layers?</p>
<p>Not because layering and frameworks don’t matter—everyone is already professional there. Layering and modularity are basic common sense and skills, so they usually aren’t the focus of debate and decisions. If you can’t quickly agree on layers and frameworks, either the team composition is off or the problem is so complex it’s no longer in the 80% case.</p>
<p>Deliverables at this stage: architecture diagram and shared understanding of problem, value, cost, risk, and responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-architecture-design--requirements-look-at-use-cases">Minimalist Architecture Design — Requirements Look at Use Cases</h2>
<p>Requirements are the answer to the problem. I like to <mark>use mind maps or a blank sheet to draw</mark> and make requirements clear. What to draw? Clarify roles and list actions and behaviors.</p>
<p>What’s a good way to organize everything? I often use a <mark>subject–verb–object (and adjuncts)</mark> approach: who does what, in what scenario (optional), in what state (optional).</p>
<p>

<p>Use cases break requirements down clearly, and you keep communicating with the stakeholders in the process.</p>
<p><mark>Demo scripts are the product manager’s weapon; requirement use cases are the engineer’s weapon.</mark></p>
<p>Some junior engineers unconsciously become mere executors of requirements. I’d say engineers who don’t understand the business aren’t much different from outsourced labor. The requirement analysis phase is crucial—it’s the chance to understand, structure, and redesign the business input. By organizing use cases, we can push back on unrealistic or unreliable requirements.</p>
<p>This is one of the few phases where we can influence (and give feedback to) the requirement side; make the most of it.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of a product use case:</p>
<p>

<p>This use case was actually summarized by “the other side” 😄, but it still shows how important use cases are.</p>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>Besides subject–verb–object, other useful techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>User journey (action path): imagine the path the user (or actor) takes to reach their goal</li>
<li>Prioritize solving the 20% of issues on the core path</li>
<li>Organize use cases by role, orthogonal split, etc.; assign use cases to modules</li>
</ul>
<p>Deliverables: demo script, use case diagram.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-architecture-design--design-looks-at-the-model">Minimalist Architecture Design — Design Looks at the Model</h2>
<p>To me, the core of design is the <strong>model</strong>: <mark>the model defines the carrier and boundaries of data</mark>. <mark>Data defines the components; boundaries define ownership and responsibility.</mark> In UML, many entities and objects are used to define model boundaries. As the business system grows in complexity, modeling faces greater challenges.</p>
<p>A few modeling principles I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define terms (in both languages if needed), meaning, and notes.</li>
<li>Identify core models (focus on the critical 20%).</li>
<li>Refine and abstract models.</li>
<li>Make relationships between models explicit.</li>
<li>Combine static and dynamic: a few models have behavior; focus on the functions they provide.</li>
<li>Map business model ↔ data model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people don’t care about a glossary, but I do. There’s an effect called “foreign language effect”—like using Latin/Greek in natural history to describe species. For non-native English engineers, using English for terms can help focus the discussion.</p>
<p>Always keep the 80/20 rule in mind, especially in design: focus on core objects and zoom in on them rather than getting lost in details. Usually, focusing on the core 20% of models is enough for most scenarios.</p>
<p>When refining and abstracting models, iterate carefully. You can connect this to earlier use case definition and later sequence design; it takes solid domain knowledge. I like to refer to external code and designs at this stage.</p>
<p>Relationships between models are mainly 1:1, 1:N, M:N. Use arrows to show primary vs. secondary clearly. Primary/secondary implies ownership and affects many downstream details (URLs, database, lifecycle, etc.). I recommend avoiding M:N when possible; it often indicates an intermediate credential or relationship/binding.</p>
<p>Besides static data, consider model behavior (only a few models have it). This stage can feed into the next step—detailed design.</p>
<p>After the business model, think about the data model. For typical business systems, this mapping is straightforward. Business systems are often stateless and rely on the database for storage. For data-intensive applications (DIA), you need to think about runtime data, lifecycle, and availability (if you have that need, you probably aren’t reading this far 😄).</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example</h3>
<p>Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a common AuthZ (authorization) system (not AuthN—authentication).</p>
<p>

<p><small>image via <a href="https://dev.to/alcide/kubernetes-rbac-moving-from-it-s-complicated-to-in-a-relationship-1bbm">Kubernetes RBAC - DEV Community</a></small></p>
<p>A few questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why both Role and ClusterRole? What’s their structure?</li>
<li>Why not ACL? What’s the difference between ACL and RBAC?</li>
<li>Why not Policy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Modeling is what gives you these answers.</p>
<h3 id="models-in-non-business-systems">Models in Non-Business Systems</h3>
<p>We’ve been focusing on business models—what users perceive and the product understands, usually stored in the DB.</p>
<p>In infrastructure, there are models too, sometimes called “concepts.” Infrastructure models are often simpler; business models can be very complex because the world is complex, while infrastructure focuses on narrow, vertical problems.</p>
<p>Infrastructure also leads to more abstract modeling—e.g. the often-overlooked Manager/Service pattern. Models with data and state, like Executor, are common; Registry and Queue are common too.</p>
<p>Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/">Concepts</a>—dozens of subcategories and hundreds of concepts—show how complex such a system can be.</p>
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>Models are not just data; they define boundaries, and boundaries determine ownership and responsibility.</p>
<p>Design models in both static and dynamic terms: statically what they hold, dynamically what they do.</p>
<p>In infrastructure, deliverables may include UML model diagram, ER diagram, DB DML, class files, OpenAPI/Swagger (partially), etc.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-architecture-design--details-look-at-the-sequence">Minimalist Architecture Design — Details Look at the Sequence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming = Data structures + Algorithms + Control flow</p></blockquote>
<p>Before turning design into code, the last important step is nailing the details. For stakeholders and decision makers this step may not matter much, but for the implementers (the dev team) it directly affects delivery quality and timeline.</p>
<p>I think details should be captured in <strong>sequence diagrams</strong>.</p>
<p>We often use two kinds of diagrams for details: <mark>flowcharts and sequence diagrams</mark>. They have a lot in common, but I prefer sequence diagrams because they show order and make the boundaries and interactions between systems clear.</p>
<p>My rule of thumb: one sequence diagram per use case.</p>
<h3 id="example-3">Example</h3>
<p>Example from an official AWS blog:</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202307/aws-seq.png" alt="Header-based API Gateway versioning with CloudFront"  />


</p>
<p><small>via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/sequence-diagrams-enrich-your-understanding-of-distributed-architectures/">AWS Architecture Blog</a></small></p>
<p>The diagram shows a sequence for using CloudFront in AWS: how requests flow across systems and how various error cases are handled.</p>
<h3 id="summary-3">Summary</h3>
<p>A few tips for sequence diagrams:</p>
<ul>
<li>User action is the trigger</li>
<li>System boundaries must be clear</li>
<li>Request and response = synchronous</li>
<li>Request without response = asynchronous</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, once the sequence diagram is solid, you can hand off to the team with confidence. Without it, you rely entirely on collaboration and trust.</p>
<p>Deliverables: sequence diagram, API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger), frontend service generation (if applicable).</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-architecture-design--wrap-up">Minimalist Architecture Design — Wrap-up</h2>
<p>By this point we haven’t written code yet, but we know what to do and what it will look like. We have class structure, API definitions, frontend service generation, etc. Multiple teams can work in parallel without obvious bottlenecks.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Problem defined</li>
<li>✅ Approach chosen</li>
<li>✅ Class structure, API definitions</li>
<li>✅ Server-side code generation</li>
<li>✅ Flow agreed</li>
<li>✅ About 1/3 of reporting material</li>
<li>✅ About 1/2 of tech talk material</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to report later, you already have about one third of the content. If you need to write a tech talk, you have about half.</p>
<p>If the project is a simple CRUD app, there usually aren’t many hard parts.</p>
<p>If it’s a data-intensive application (DIA), you need to design and implement storage and think about consistency and concurrency. For a complex system, you also need to check for uncertainty at the boundaries between systems. If you have sync challenges (e.g. framework changes, communication layer changes), de-risk early. (I don’t think doing tech upgrades and feature development in parallel is wise.)</p>
<h2 id="extra--drawing-tools">Extra — Drawing Tools</h2>
<p>I have my own set of drawing tools for architecture diagrams, flowcharts, etc. P.S. I even design logos for my products—maybe I’ve always wanted to be a designer 🙂</p>
<p>As an engineer, you should build your own drawing UI kit, get good at it, and put together a toolbox so you can turn ideas in your head into documents quickly.</p>
<p>My toolkit is fairly rich. For architecture diagrams:</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When starting to create a new system, or participating in a new team or project, there is a simple but profound question: Is there a design specification for the API of this system (Web Server)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<p>This issue has bothered me for a long time, starting during my school days, and every time I needed to communicate and discuss with my team members.
From the initial free style to the later REST, I often referenced <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">Github v3</a> to the project team and the
Foursqure API (no longer accessible, exposing age) documentation.
However, in practice, there are still cases where there is a mismatch with the actual work or the common company specification.
This is when I need to do some additional work. Eventually, I will write a brief <code>DEVELOPMENT.md</code> document to describe the design solution.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always had more ideas for that document, and it&rsquo;s not quite good enough. So, I wanted to put together a <mark>Simple and Pragmatic</mark> Web API best practice, which is this article.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-need-api-uniformity-specifications">Why We Need API Uniformity Specifications</h2>
<p>The problem seems obvious, but a deeper analysis involves teamwork efficiency and engineering design philosophy.</p>
<p>API (Application Programming Interface) is the bridge between different software systems to interact with each other. When communicating between different software systems, the
APIs allow data transfer and processing in a standardized way, enabling the integration of various applications.</p>
<p>When we start writing API documentation, a paradigm (Design Pattern) emerges, whether it is explicit or implicit, whether
Whether it is one set for each or a common set. This is just like when we use a unified USB interface, unification reduces costs and avoids possible errors. Specifically, there are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of understanding and efficiency: service providers and consumers use a unified form, structure and usage, and a unified production-consumption protocol, thus reducing communication costs.</li>
<li>Expert experience: It contains best engineering practices with corresponding solutions for common scenarios, avoiding the need for everyone to rethink the entire API system.
For example, how do you handle API caching? How to perform authentication? How to handle data formatting?</li>
<li>Extensibility: extensibility require stable protocols, protocols are abstract and implementation-independent, and not everyone has them
The ability to design uncertainty-oriented systems, and some widely used technologies plan for a wider range of scenarios.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><small>image by alswl</small></p>
<p>While it is true that there are some costs associated with the use of a unified specification that requires framework understanding and promotion, I believe that in most scenarios
the benefits of a unified specification far outweigh these costs.</p>
<p>However, not all cases require consideration of the API specification. For short lifecycle projects, internal projects and products with a very small impact
specifications may not require much attention. In addition, in some special business scenarios, the
The underlying protocol may change, and the existing specification may no longer be applicable. But even so, I still recommend redrafting a new specification, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-rules">Principles of rules</h2>
<p>When developing API specifications, we should follow some basic principles to deal with technical differences, and I have summarized three principles that have gained wide acceptance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: Simplicity is the most direct and effective strategy to resist complexity, using the principle of simplicity to reduce complexity and avoid the breeding and proliferation of complexity;</li>
<li>Consistency: uniform design patterns and continuity of design styles help reduce engineering costs and the psychological burden on engineers;</li>
<li>follow reality: follow the abstractions and layering of existing engineering domains (e.g. HTTP, REST, RBAC, OIDC, etc.) and do not invent new concepts of your own.
Always think about whether the problem is the only one you have encountered (the answer is definitely no).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-rest-work-or-not">Does REST work or not?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful API</a> has become a popular protocol in the Web API space.
Its broad applicability and reach stems from its binding to the HTTP protocol, which allows RESTful APIs to easily interact with existing Web technologies. If you are not familiar with REST, you can check out [Yifeng Ruan&rsquo;s
You can check out <a href="https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/05/restful_api.html">Yifeng Ruan&rsquo;s RESTful API Design Guide</a> and

<p>REST is a high maturity protocol, which <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level0">Leonard Richardson</a>
describes it as having four levels of maturity:</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202304/rest-four-level.png" alt="rest-four-level"  />


</p>

<ol>
<li>The Swamp of POX, using HTTP to host the Legacy protocol (XML)</li>
<li>Resources: using resource abstraction</li>
<li>HTTP Verbs: using rich HTTP Verbs</li>
<li>Hypermedia Controls: API resource integration using <code>rel</code> links, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a> is the pinnacle of performance</li>
</ol>
<p>The core strength of REST is that</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes full advantage of the design of the HTTP Protocol (HTTP Protocol)</li>
<li>It has excellent identification of resources</li>
<li>It is designed with complete manipulation of resources (Manipulation of resources)</li>
<li>It has Self-descriptive messages</li>
<li>It supports multiple forms of presentation (hypermedia as the engine of application state)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <mark>REST is not a specific protocol or specification, but a style philosophy</mark>. While REST defines rules and principles such as the identification of resources, unified interfaces, stateless communication, etc., it does not prescribe a specific protocol or specification.
it does not prescribe a specific way to implement them. As a result, in practice, different teams may have different understandings and practices, leading to inconsistencies and portability of the API.
This leads to inconsistency and reduced maintainability of the API.</p>
<p>In addition, REST has a number of limitations and drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all requests can be described by resources, such as the login (<code>/login</code>) operation, which is very convoluted when converted to <code>session</code>;
The same problem arises for operations like money transfers, where the limited number of HTTP verbs cannot support all business scenarios.</li>
<li>REST does not provide a clear solution to the inevitable problems such as paging, specific structure of the return body, error handling and authentication, etc.</li>
<li>For complex queries (such as Search Search), the query parameters of the RESTful API can become very complex and difficult to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, although the REST style is a good guideline, the specific implementation needs to be combined with specific business requirements and technical features to make some trade-offs in order to achieve a good API design.
Finally, do we need a Web API design specification that follows the REST style? I think REST can solve 90% of the problems, but there is still 10% need to specify the details.</p>
<h2 id="web-api-specification-multiple-choice-questions">Web API specification multiple choice questions</h2>
<p>Since our protocol is based on HTTP and REST design, we will base our discussion on the four core parts of an HTTP request: URL, Header, Request and Response.
These are: URL, Header, Request and Response.</p>
<h3 id="url-best-practices">URL Best Practices</h3>
<p>My inspiration for URL design came from <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">Ruby on Rails</a>.
Before that, I always instinctively put model information on top of URLs, but in reality good URL design should be a plan for the information structure of the system.
Therefore, URL design should consider not only the API, but also the user-oriented Web URL.</p>
<p>To achieve good URL design, I have summarized the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate resources (this answers the question of whether paging should be in the Header)</li>
<li>Self-explanatory (readable, the URL itself contains the core information)</li>
<li>Security (can not contain user authentication information, OAuth spent a lot of effort to understand this, anti-forgery)</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, the URL model is as follows:</p>
<p><code>/$(prefix)/$(module)/$(model)/$(sub-model)/$(verb)?$(query)#${fragment}</code></p>
<p>where Prefix may be the version of the API, or it may be a special qualification, as some companies rely on for access layer triage;
Module is a business module, which can also be omitted; Model is a model; SubModel is a submodel, which can be omitted;
Verb is a verb, which can also be omitted; Query is a request parameter; Fragment is an HTTP primitive Fragment.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all components are required to appear. For example, fields such as SubModel and Verb can
be allowed to be hidden in different URL styles.</p>

<p><strong>Version advantage in URLs</strong></p>
<p>We follow the principle of consistency when designing URLs; the same URL is used to access the same resource, regardless of identity or state.
This is also the basic principle of Uniform Resource Location. While we can accept different content formats (e.g. JSON / YAML / HTML / PDF / etc.)
but we want the location of the resource to be unique.</p>
<p>However, the question is, should the same resource be reflected in the URL for rendering between versions? This depends on whether the designer considers versioning to be in the realm of location information.</p>
<p>According to the RFC design, in addition to the URL there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URN (Uniform Resource Name)</a>.
The latter is used to identify the resource, while the URL points to the resource address. In practice, URNs are not so widely used that URIs are almost equivalent to URLs.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Verb is not enough</strong></p>
<p>In REST design, we need to operate on resources using HTTP verbs like GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / PATCH / HEAD.
For example, using the API <code>GET /apis/books</code> to view book listings is natural and reasonable.
However, when it comes to performing an action like &ldquo;borrow a book
we don&rsquo;t have a suitable verb (BORROW) to represent it. In this case, there are two possible options:</p>
<ol>
<li>use the POST method with a custom verb, such as <code>POST /apis/books/borrow</code>, for the action of borrowing a book;</li>
<li>creating a book borrow log, using a resource add method to structure the non-existent action, e.g. <code>POST /apis/books/borrow-log/</code>;</li>
</ol>
<p>This issue comes up a lot in complex scenarios such as user login (<code>POST /api/auth/login</code> vs <code>POST /api/session</code>) and account transfers (vs transfer record creation), etc.
<mark>API abstract or concrete, there is always an explanation of the business. </mark> We can&rsquo;t simply generalize all of our business to CRUD.
Rather, we need to divide the business wisely to make it clearer and more understandable to users.</p>
<p>When designing, we can consider whether we need to create a corresponding button for each API to make it easier for users to do so.
If there is only one API named <code>/api/do</code> and all the services are bound to it, although technically possible, this design does not meet the business requirements.
Each layer of abstraction is designed to standardize the solution to a particular problem, and the TCP L7 design is a reflection of this philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Readable Stable Identity explained</strong></p>
<p>When marking a resource, we typically have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ID: IDs are usually bound to database self-incrementing IDs.</li>
<li>Use a GUID: such as a UUID, although less precise.</li>
<li>Use Readable Stable Identity: Usually identified by name, UID, or a specific ID such as a host name, IP address, or serial number.
This identifier is required to be stable and globally unique, which is useful in internal systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a personal design tip: use a slug of the form <code>${type}/${type-id}</code> to describe an identifier.
For example <code>hostname/abc.sqa</code> or <code>ip/172.133.2.1</code>.
This design approach provides a good balance between readability and uniqueness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A slug is a human-readable, unique identifier, used to identify a resource instead of a less human-readable identifier like an id .</p></blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://itnext.io/whats-a-slug-f7e74b6c23e0">What&rsquo;s a slug. and why would I use one? | by Dave Sag</a></p>
<p>PS: At the end of the article I&rsquo;ll also introduce an Apple Music solution that combines the ID / Readable / Stable features.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of one-level and multi-level</strong></p>
<p>The hierarchical design of URLs can be based on modeling, or a straightforward single-level structure can be used. specific problem solving approach.
For example, when designing user-owned books, one can choose a multi-level structure <code>/api/users/foo/books</code> or a one-level structure <code>/api/books?owner=foo</code>.</p>
<p>Both options are technically possible, <mark>the former respecting the attribution of the model, and the latter focusing on the simplicity of the URL structure</mark>.</p>
<p>A multi-level structure is more intuitive, but also needs to address the issue of possible multiple ways of organization, such as books in a library organized by author or category?
In this case, consider making the attribution of models explicit in a multi-level structure
For example <code>/api/author/foo/books</code> (based on authors) or <code>/api/category/computer/books</code> (based on categories).</p>
<p><strong>Alias URL explanation</strong></p>
<p>For some frequently used URLs, although they can be designed according to URL rules, we can still design a more concise URL that
to facilitate user presentation and use. This design is especially common for Web URLs. For example, the API for a library&rsquo;s most popular books:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Original URL
https://test.com/apis/v3/books?sort=hot&amp;limit=10

# Alias URL
https://test.com/apis/v3/books/hot
</code></pre><p><strong>Model abbreviations explained</strong></p>
<p>Often, when modeling resources, longer names are used to name them, for example a book index might be named <code>BookIndex</code> instead of <code>Index</code>.
When rendering in URLs, since the URL prefix of <code>/book/book-index</code> contains Book, we can reduce the layer of description and
We can make the URL more concise, for example by using <code>/book/index</code>. This technique is very common in Web URL design.</p>
<p>There is also a strategy of model abbreviation, which provides a complete set of alias registration schemes. aliases that are globally unique.
For example, in Kubernetes, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.26/#deployment-v1-apps">Deployment</a>
is a common naming, while <code>apps/v1/Deployment</code> is the full name by adding a Group restriction.
There is also a shorthand for <code>deploy</code>. This mechanism relies on Kubernetes&rsquo; API Schema system for registration and work.</p>
<h3 id="header-best-practices">Header Best Practices</h3>
<p>We often overlook the importance of the Header. In fact, the selection of HTTP verbs, HTTP status codes, and various authentication logic (e.g., cookies / Basic Auth / Berear Token) all depend on the design of the Header.

<p><strong>About only using POST</strong></p>
<p>Some novices (or those who consider themselves experienced) may come to the erroneous conclusion that, with the exception of GET requests
all HTTP requests should use the POST method. Some even demand that <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/336797348">all actions (even read-only requests) should use the POST method</a>.
This argument is often supported on the grounds of &ldquo;simple consistency&rdquo;, &ldquo;cache avoidance&rdquo;, or &ldquo;operator requirements&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, it is important to understand the original design of the HTTP method: it is used to describe the type of resource manipulation that gives rise to a number of issues including caching, security, and idempotency.
In relatively simple scenarios, omitting this layer of abstraction really doesn&rsquo;t pose much of a problem, but once you get into the complexities of the domain, the
Using this layer of abstraction for HTTP methods becomes very important. <mark>Whether this follows the standard or not will determine whether you get the benefits of standardization</mark>.
The analogy is like a new phone manufacturer that can choose not to use the USB TypeC interface.
It&rsquo;s technically possible, but it also loses a lot of standardization support and mental agreement.</p>
<p>I especially like one <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/huixiong-19">Knowing user</a>&rsquo;s

<p><strong>2XX family</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of HTTP status codes is to indicate the result of communication between the client and the server. 2XX status code family means that the server has successfully received, understood, and processed the client request,
understood and processed the client request, and the response was successful. The following are common status codes in the 2XX family and their meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 OK: The request was processed successfully and the server returned a response.</li>
<li>201 Created: The request has been successfully processed and a new resource has been created on the server.</li>
<li>202 Accepted: The request has been accepted by the server, but not yet executed. This status code is typically used for asynchronous processing.</li>
<li>204 No Content: The request was processed successfully, but the server did not return any response body content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2XX family of status codes indicates that the request has been successfully processed. These status codes let the client know explicitly that the request has been processed correctly so that it can proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>The need to use the 2XX family of status codes across the board depends on whether the client needs to be explicitly/displayed with information that
inform it of the next action. If it has been clearly described by other means (including documentation, verbal agreements)
then it is indeed possible to use 200 status codes across the board for return. But passing meaning based on behavior.
or document-based (or even verbal)? Is it more complex or more concise?</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of paging methods</strong></p>
<p>The two most common types of paging we see are Page-based and Offset-based, which can be mapped by formula.
In addition, there exists a method called Continuation Token, which is similar in technique to Oracle&rsquo;s
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/241622/paging-with-oracle">rownum paging scheme</a>, using the parameter <code>start-from=? </code> to describe it.
While the advantages and disadvantages of Continuation Token are significant, using this approach allows sequential to be used as an alternative to random.</p>
<p><strong>Paging controls interpretation</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we need to distinguish between Client Pagination and Server Pagniation.
Client Pagination means that the parameters of the next page are calculated by the client, while Server Pagination is a protocol such as <code>rel</code> or JSON.API returned by the server.
Using Server Pagniation avoids some problems, such as bulk blocking of some content, which may result in missing pages or white screens if client-side paging is used.</p>

<p><strong>Several forms of models</strong></p>
<p>In API design, there are several definitions for how models should be represented. Although this is not a topic that must be discussed in the API specification, it is very important for API design.</p>
<p>I have divided the model presentation that models are often described into the following categories, which are not professionally defined and borrow some definitions from the Java context below.
These names will be called differently in different companies and even different teams:</p>
<p>




<img loading="lazy" src="https://en.blog.alswl.com/img/202304/models.png" alt="models"  />


</p>
<p><small>image by alswl</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Business Object (BO): the original business model</li>
<li>Data Object (DO): the model stored to the RDBMS, so it must be a flat field structure, sometimes a BO will correspond to multiple DOs</li>
<li>View Object (VO): the model presented to the presentation layer, only keep the information the user needs to see, such as sensitive information will be removed</li>
<li>Data Transfer Object (DTO): the model used to transfer in the RPC system, generally not much different from the original Model, depending on the different serialization systems will have differences
(such as the handling of enumerations)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two other categories are often used: Rich Model and Tiny Model (please ignore the naming, it varies a lot from team to team):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Model: This model is used to describe a rich model, which contains almost all the data needed and allows nesting of sub-resources.</li>
<li>Tiny Model: is a compact model, often used in the list API to be used</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linking, sidecar, and embedding of models</strong></p>
<p>In API design, we often need to deal with cases where a model contains multiple submodels, such as a Book containing Comments.
For this case, there are usually three representations to choose from: Link, Side, and Embed.</p>

<p>There are some other issues that are not converged in the four elements, but we often encounter them in engineering practice, and I will run them out:</p>
<p>**I&rsquo;m not in the HTTP protocol, what should I do? ** I&rsquo;m not in the HTTP protocol, what should I do?</p>
<p>Non-HTTP protocols are less commonly encountered in Web APIs, and the cost of creating a new set of protocols is too high. There are protocols that are introduced in certain areas.
For example, <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> in the IoT domain.</p>
<p>In addition, RPC is a wide-ranging concept that goes far beyond the protocol level.
Often we compare the transport protocols of HTTP and RPC, as well as serialization protocols.
I believe that much of the discussion in this paper is also of importance to the RPC community.</p>
<p>Some teams or individuals plan to use protocols that they create themselves, but my opinion is that self-built protocols should be avoided as much as possible, because it is very rare that there is a real need to create a protocol.
If a strong need does exist, then I would ask two questions: Have you read through the HTTP RFC document and the HTTP/2 RFC document?</p>
<p>**I&rsquo;m not a remote service (RPC / HTTP etc.), but what about the SDK? ** This article focuses on Web APIs (RPC/ HTTP etc.).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the design specifications of the Web API (HTTP) and some of the rules can be applied to RPC systems.
However, the basis of the discussion is based on Remote Service.
If you are an SDK developer, you will have two roles, possibly as a client communicating with a remote server, and as an SDK providing developer-oriented services.
You will also provide developer-facing interfaces as an SDK. For the latter, the following specifications can be used as a reference:</p>
<p>For the latter, you can refer to these specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure SDK Design Specifications <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_design.html">General Guidelines: API Design | Azure SDKs</a></li>
<li>Posix API examples (e.g. File <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Low_002dLevel-I_002fO.html">Low-Level I/O (The GNU C Library)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authentication Authentication Scheme</strong></p>
<p>In general, the Web API design will clearly describe the authentication and authentication system to be used.
It is important to distinguish between the concepts of &ldquo;authentication&rdquo; and &ldquo;authentication&rdquo;. The topic of &ldquo;authentication&rdquo; can be discussed in a separate section, so this paper will not cover this aspect.</p>
<p>In Web API design, common authentication methods include HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth2, and account password login.
In addition, HMac algorithm-based anti-replay and anti-tampering schemes are used for anti-tampering.</p>
<p><strong>Overlooked Topics</strong></p>
<p>In this discussion, I did not cover the following topics: asynchronous protocols (Web Sockets / Long Pulling / Round Trials), CORS, and security issues.
Although these topics are important, they will not be covered in this article.</p>
<p><strong>When to break the rules</strong></p>
<p>Some developers believe that rules are there to be broken. The reality is often so complex that it is difficult to discuss the details.
If a developer feels that a rule does not meet the actual need, there are two ways to handle it: change the rule or break it.
However, I prefer to discuss and update the rules, clarify where the specification is inadequate, and determine if there are special cases.
If a special case does need to be created, be sure to describe it in detail in the documentation, informing the successor and the consumer that it is a special case, explaining why the special case was created and how the special case responds.</p>

<p>Github&rsquo;s API is one that I often refer to. It models its business domain very clearly, provides thorough documentation, and makes communication much less costly.
I mainly refer to the following two links:
API Definition <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">GitHub REST API documentation</a> and
a list of application-oriented APIs [Endpoints available for GitHub Apps](<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps">https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps</a>? apiVersion=2022-11-28)
This list includes almost all of Github&rsquo;s APIs.</p>

<p>Azure&rsquo;s API design follows [api-guidelines/Guidelines.md at master - microsoft/api-guidelines](<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/">https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/</a> master/Guidelines.md).
This article is schematic, and there is also a practical guide at [Best practices in cloud applications](<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/index">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/index</a> -best-practices)
and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design">Web API design best practices</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Azure&rsquo;s product line is much richer than Github, and some APIs do not follow Azure&rsquo;s own specifications.
When looking for examples, I mainly refer to
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/?view=Azure">REST API Browser</a>, the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/">Azure Storage REST API Reference</a>.
If the specific implementation conflicts with the Guidelines.md, I will use the Guidelines.md conclusion.</p>

<p>The overall design style of Azure is more complex than the Github API, and there are multiple versions of the same product, making it a little less uniform.
It looks a little less uniform. It is also more difficult to have a single specification that binds all teams in this complex scenario.
We can see that the Azaure team is working on the Guidelines, and they are recently launching the vNext specification.</p>
<h3 id="my-personal-style">My personal style</h3>
<p>My personal style is basically inherited from the Github API style, with some minor adjustments to make it more suitable for small and medium-sized product development.
The reasons for my changes are explained in the notes, and the starting point for changes is: simplify / reduce ambiguity / consider the actual cost. If &ldquo;Note&rdquo; is marked in the notes, it follows the Github scheme and adds some ideas.</p>

<p><small>image from Apple Music</small></p>
<p>I was recently using Apple Music and noticed the URL structure of its web page:</p>
<p><code>/cn/album/we-sing-we-dance-we-steal-things/277635758?l=en</code></p>
<p>Looking closely at this URL structure, I can see that the Path contains human-readable slug in three parts: <code>alumn/$(name)/$(id)</code> (which contains the ID).
A question immediately occurred to me: are the intermediate readable names machine-sensitive and purely geared towards natural humans?
So I tested a fabricated address: <code>/cn/album/foobar/277635758?l=en</code>.
Can you guess if the result is accessible before you try to access it?</p>
<p>This design paradigm is a bit more complex than my current common URL design specification. My specification requires that the resource locale be organized using a two-level slug, <code>$(type)/$(id)</code>.
Whereas Apple uses <code>$(type)/(type-id)/$(id)</code>, taking care of both readability and accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="off-topic---why-graphql-doesnt-work">Off-Topic - Why GraphQL Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h2>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a way to request APIs by using a custom query language, which has the advantage of providing a more flexible way to fetch data.
Compared to RESTful APIs that require a single request for all the data needed, GraphQL allows the client to explicitly specify the data needed, thus reducing unnecessary data transfer and processing.</p>
<p>However, GraphQL&rsquo;s over-flexibility is also one of its drawbacks. Since it does not have some specifications for modeling business scenarios like the REST API, developers need to think about data processing themselves.
developers need to think about how to handle the data themselves.
This can lead to unreasonable query requests that can put excessive pressure on the back-end database. In addition, GraphQL has relatively few implementations and documentation, which also requires more learning costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, while GraphQL can provide better results in some specific scenarios, it is not suitable for all API design needs.
In fact, some companies have even chosen to drop support for GraphQL, such as Github&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-18-deprecation-notice-graphql-for-packages/">some projects</a>.</p>

</ul></blockquote>
<p><mark>There is no best style, only the best fit, but it is important to have style. &lt;/mark</p>
<p>Building a good rule requires not only a deep understanding of existing mechanisms, but also a thorough grasp of the business domain, and effective collaboration and communication within the team to promote and implement the rule.
Once established, however, rules can effectively reduce the complexity of the system, avoiding increasing complexity over time and as the business progresses, and reducing communication costs on the R&amp;D side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long-term investment, but one that will pay off in the long run. I hope those with a long-term view will take note of this article.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Static typing is becoming more and more popular.
Several languages born after 2010, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc., have gone the static typing route.
Some of the previously popular dynamic languages (Python, PHP, JavaScript) are also actively introducing new language features (Type Hint, TypeScript) to enhance static typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having worked on larger projects in Python, I have experienced the difficulties that dynamic languages pose when projects get large:
The cost of code regression during the refactoring phase was unusually high, and much of the historical code was afraid to move.
Then the technology stack shifted to Java, and being embraced by the type system made people feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Static typing is becoming more and more popular.
Several languages born after 2010, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc., have gone the static typing route.
Some of the previously popular dynamic languages (Python, PHP, JavaScript) are also actively introducing new language features (Type Hint, TypeScript) to enhance static typing.</p>
<p>Having worked on larger projects in Python, I have experienced the difficulties that dynamic languages pose when projects get large:
The cost of code regression during the refactoring phase was unusually high, and much of the historical code was afraid to move.
Then the technology stack shifted to Java, and being embraced by the type system made people feel safe.</p>
<p>In the last year, I have been working on a stability-oriented operation and maintenance system. Python was used at the beginning of the system selection.
I pushed Python 3.7 in the project and used Python&rsquo;s type system on a large scale to mitigate potential risks.</p>
<p>Going back to my roots, I spent some time learning about Python&rsquo;s design and implementation of the type system.
This article is a PEP proposal that describes how far Python has come with the type system.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2 id="type-systems">Type Systems</h2>
<p>Before we talk about type systems, we need to clarify two concepts, dynamic languages and dynamic types.</p>
<p>A dynamic programming language is a program that can change its structure at runtime.
This structure can include functions, objects, variable types, and program structures.
Dynamic types are one type of Type System, i.e., programs that can modify variable types during runtime.
The other type is the static type: the variable type is determined at compile time and is not allowed to change at runtime.
Another division of the type system is strong and weak types, where strong types are instructions that forbid type mismatches and weak types vice versa.</p>
<p>The two concepts, dynamic languages and dynamic types, have different entry points.
Python is a dynamic language and a dynamically typed language, or a strongly typed dynamic type.
This article will focus on the type system of the Python language and will not cover dynamic language features.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-type-safety">The road to type safety</h2>
<p>There is an ongoing debate within the industry about which is more powerful: dynamic or static types.
Proponents of static types see advantages in three areas: performance, error discovery, and efficient refactoring.
Static types can significantly improve runtime efficiency by determining the concrete type at compile time;
The ability to detect errors at compile time, especially when projects get progressively larger;
The type system can help the IDE to prompt for efficient refactoring.
Proponents of dynamic typing argue that analyzing code is simpler, less error-prone, and faster to write.</p>
<p>Python developers have not failed to see this pain point.
A series of PEP proposals were created.
The type system was introduced to Python through syntax and feature enhancements while retaining the benefits of Python&rsquo;s dynamic type system.</p>
<p>Python proposed PEP 484 in 2014, followed by a refined version of PEP 483 (The Theory of Type Hints).
Its project implementation, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module, was released in 3.5.
After several iterations of PEP 484, PEP 526, PEP 544, PEP 586, PEP 589, and PEP 591, Python&rsquo;s type system has become very rich.
It even includes relatively rare features like Structural Subtyping and Literal Typing.</p>
<h3 id="pep-483---core-concepts">PEP 483 - Core Concepts</h3>
<p>Released in December 2014, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/">PEP 483</a>
This is a concise version of the core concepts Guido wrote, making clear the direction, boundaries, do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of building a type system for Python.</p>
<p>PEP 483 does not talk about concrete engineering implementations, but rather outlines how the Python type system is presented to the public.
Define the Type/Class difference, the former being a syntactic analysis concept and the latter a runtime concept.
Under this definition, a Class is a Type, but a Type is not necessarily a Class.
For example, <code>Union[str, int]</code> is a Type but not a Class.</p>
<p>PEP 483 also introduces built-in base types: <code>Any</code> / <code>Unison</code> / <code>Optional</code> / <code>Tuple</code> / <code>Callable</code>, which support rich upstream variations.</p>
<p>The biggest criticism of the static type system is that it is not flexible enough, and the Go language does not implement generics yet.
PEP 483 introduces the use of Python Generic types in a generic
The form is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TypeVar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;S&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, PEP 483 also mentions some important minor features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alias Alias</li>
<li>Farward Reference (use definition class in definition class method annotations), eg.: solves the problem of needing to reference a Node in a binary tree Node node</li>
<li>covariance contravariant</li>
<li>Use annotations to mark types</li>
<li>Transformation Cast</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of PEP 483 relies heavily on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">PEP 3107 &ndash; Function Annotations</a>.
This proposal. PEP 3107 introduces the use of function annotations. For example, <code>func(a: a1, b: b1) -&gt; r1</code>This code, thewhere the descriptors after the colon are recorded in the <code>__annotations__</code> variable of func.</p>
<p>PEP 3107 shows the effect as follows, where you can clearly see that the function variables are stored:</p>

<h3 id="pep-484---type-hints-core">PEP 484 - Type Hints Core</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">PEP 484 &ndash; Type Hints</a>
A complete description of how the Python type system is designed, how it is used, and what the details are (typing modules), building on PEP 483</p>
<p>This proposal begins by stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory,
even by convention.</p></blockquote>
<p>In one sentence, the proposal eliminates the possibility of Python evolving to a static system at the language level.</p>
<p>In addition to the features already explained in PEP 483, the proposal also appeals to me in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow adding type descriptions to already existing libraries via Stub Files. Specifically, the typed signature of Python code is described using the <code>.pyi</code> file corresponding to the Python file.
This scheme is similar to TS&rsquo;s <code>@types</code> file.</li>
<li>Allowing type overloading with <code>@overload</code> is a long time coming, and Python can actually (in a sense) support overloading.</li>
<li>Introduces typing implementation details, such as using abs (Abstract Base Class) to build interfaces for common types, including <code>Sized</code> / <code>Iterable</code> base interfaces.
Personally, I think this is actually quite a lot of work, and is a way to sort out the dependencies of existing classes.</li>
<li>Python backward (Python 2) compatible methods are introduced, and there are several strategies:
Using decorator (<code>@typehints(foo=str, returns=str)</code>), comments, Stub files, Docstring</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pep-526---variables-are-also-arranged">PEP 526 - Variables are also arranged</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/">PEP 526 - Syntax for Variable Annotations</a>
The core proposal is to add Type Hints support to variables.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>function annotation</code>, it is also stored by annotation.
The difference is that instead of adding a <code>__annotations__</code> member to the instance, the annotations information for the variable is stored in the context variable <code>__annotations__</code>.
This is actually quite understandable: when a variable type is defined, the variable is not yet initialized.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write a demo to demonstrate this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">List</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">users</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># print(__annotations__)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># {&#39;users&#39;: typing.List[int]}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the above demo has the effect of creating a <code>users</code> in the context variable, but this <code>users</code> doesn&rsquo;t actually exist, it just defines the type.
If you run <code>print(users)</code> it will throw <code>NameError: name 'users' is not defined</code>.</p>
<p>It is clearer to look at the bytecode:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> L.   1         0  SETUP_ANNOTATIONS

 L.   1         2  LOAD_CONST               0
                4  LOAD_CONST               (&#39;List&#39;,)
                6  IMPORT_NAME              typing
                8  IMPORT_FROM              List
               10  STORE_NAME               List
               12  POP_TOP

 L.   3        14  LOAD_NAME                List
               16  LOAD_NAME                int
               18  BINARY_SUBSCR
               20  LOAD_NAME                __annotations__
               22  LOAD_STR                 &#39;users&#39;
               24  STORE_SUBSCR
               26  LOAD_CONST               None
               28  RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre><p>As you can clearly see, instead of creating a variable named users, the <code>__annotations__</code> variable is used.
Note: Python stores variables using the opcode <code>STORE_NAME</code>.</p>
<p>PS: There are a number of rejected proposals in this proposal, which is quite interesting, and the community has come up with a lot of strange and clever ideas.
You can see the caution of the community decision, the difficulty of upgrading the stock system.</p>
<h3 id="pep-544---nominal-subtyping-vs-structural-subtyping">PEP 544 - Nominal Subtyping vs Structural Subtyping</h3>
<p>The type system discussed in PEP 484 is Nominal Subtyping.
This <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/">PEP 544 &ndash; Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)</a>
This <a href="">PEP 544 &ndash; Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)</a> is proposed for Structural subtyping.If I had to translate it, I think it could be called named subtypes / isomorphic subtypes.
Note that some people also refer to Structural Subtyping as Duck Typing, but the two are not the same, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#Structural_type_systems">Duck typing / Comparison with other type systems</a>.</p>
<p>Nominal Subtyping refers to matching types literally, while Structural Subtyping matches by structure (behavior).
For example, Go&rsquo;s Type is a Structural Subtyping implementation.</p>
<p>Here is a simple demo to demonstrate the latter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Iterator</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Iterable</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The code defines the type Bucket and provides two class members. These two class members happen to be the definition of Interator.Then in practice, you can use Bucket instead of Iterable.</p>
<h3 id="pep-586--pep-589--pep-591-continuous-enhancement">PEP 586 / PEP 589 / PEP 591 Continuous enhancement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0586/">PEP 586 &ndash; Literal Types</a>
The Python 3.8 implementation supports the use of literals as types.
For example <code>Literal[4]</code>, and for a more semantic example <code>Literal['GREEN']</code>.</p>
<p>My first thought was that this is very similar to Symbol in Scala, which is written as <code>Symbol(&quot;GREEN&quot;)</code>.
This feature is quite collegial and easy to write in the DSL.Scala officials have said that the Symbol feature may be removed in the future, so it is recommended to use constants instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/">PEP 589 &ndash; TypedDict: Type Hints for Dictionaries with a Fixed Set of Keys</a>
Add a Type of key to Dict, inheriting from <code>TypedDict</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591/">PEP 591 &ndash; Adding a final qualifier to typing</a>
Add the concepts of <code>final</code> / <code>Final</code>, the former is a decorator, the latter is an annotation that marks the class/function/variable as unmodifiable.</p>
<p>At this point, Python 3.8 has the type system features we need every day (not at runtime 😂).</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the <code>typing</code> module is clearly marked in the documentation as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools
such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Namely, the Python runtime (Intercepter / Code Evaluator) does not support type decorators for functions and variables.
These decorators can only be checked by third-party tools, such as type checkers, IDEs, statics, and Linter.</p>
<p>This information illustrates the limitations of Python&rsquo;s attempts at type safety. All the restrictions, constraints, and limitations don&rsquo;t happen at runtime.
The only way to harvest engineering-above-board value from the type system is to use third-party tools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the Python community is trying to move closer to a type system, but how far can this non-language level Runtime support go?
Python lacks a golden father, and its godfather Red Hat has limited resources to invest. Even the community hasn&rsquo;t finished switching from Python 2 to Python 3 yet, so why?
The input/output ratio is too low, the new features are not attractive enough, and there are too many alternatives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, look at the competition:
Dynamic languages are moving closer to static languages, and static languages are absorbing features from dynamic languages. For example, the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in Java 14.
Kotlin / Scala and other languages Type Inference.
Perhaps this evolution is more acceptable to users.</p>
